Introduction
Ever wonder how your inbox gets flooded with promotional emails from
companies you’ve never heard of? Chances are, your data is being sold or
shared without your explicit consent. But how can you find out which
websites are the culprits? In this post I explain how to setup a
honeypot email address to catch data-selling websites red-handed.
What is a Honeypot Email Address?
A honeypot email address is a decoy email that you use exclusively for
signing up on websites, newsletters, or online services. The idea is
simple: if you start receiving unsolicited emails to that address, you
know that the website you used it on has likely sold or shared your
data. If you own your own domain[s] and can setup email aliases then you
can too can investigate who is selling you out.
How to Set Up a Honeypot Email Address
Setting up a honeypot email address has varying levels of difficulty,
depending on your expertise, your ISP’s tools and mostly your ability to
create many unique email aliases or accounts. This requires a domain
that you control that receives email that you can configure or a whole
lot of gmail accounts.
Step 1: Create a New Email Address
Create a new email address that you’ll use solely as your honeypot. This
should be separate from your personal or work email to avoid any
confusion.
Step 2: Use Aliases
Many email providers like Gmail allow you to create aliases by appending
a plus sign and additional text to your email address (e.g.,
yourname+website@gmail.com). This way, you can track which website the
spam is coming from.
Step 3: Sign Up
Use this honeypot email when signing up for newsletters, online
services, or any website that requires an email address.
Step 4: Monitor
Keep an eye on the inbox and take note of any unsolicited emails. If you
start receiving spam, check the alias to identify the source.
Benefits of a Honeypot Email
1.  Accountability
    By identifying which websites are selling your data, you can hold
    them accountable and opt to discontinue using their services.
2.  Awareness
    It raises awareness about the extent of data selling and sharing
    that occurs behind the scenes.
3.  Control
    It gives you more control over your personal data and who has access
    to it.
Limitations and Considerations
1.  Time-Consuming
    Setting up and monitoring multiple honeypot emails can be
    time-consuming. What are you getting in return and what is that
    worth to you?
2.  Not Foolproof
    Some savvy data sellers may strip email aliases or use other methods
    to obfuscate the source.
3.  Legal Ramifications
    While it’s tempting to publicly shame companies that sell your data,
    be cautious. Accusations could have legal ramifications, so it’s
    best to approach the company privately first.
Conclusion
Honeypot email addresses are a clever and effective way to find out
who’s selling your data. While it’s not a perfect system, it does offer
a level of control and awareness that can be empowering for users. So go
ahead, set up your honeypot, and start unmasking those data sellers.
Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to protecting your personal
information.
