    Game Concept
    AR Alternate Reality Mobile Game
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An idea I've been kicking around for an Alternate Reality game that
    uses Augmented Reality and provides challenges and quests that
    involve using your phone camera to locate virtual coins and gems
    placed by other players in the real world or scanning a QR codes or
    taking pictures of historic locations or art murals. The game
    involves getting the players to perform actions that become the
    challenge for another player. As an example: say you've been given
    quest to pick up a QR code sticker from a ^[[D^[[local merchant and
    place that sticker on Lotta's Fountain on Market Street. You place
    the sticker and checkin and then the system will assign the
    challenge of scanning that QR code to other players until a player
    reports that the sticker is gone and the system starts again.

    The Vigilance Committees of San Francisco
    Guardians or Vigilantes?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    San Francisco in the 1850s was a city of stark contrasts. It was a
    burgeoning hub of opportunity following the Gold Rush of 1849,
    attracting fortune-seekers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers. However,
    this rapid growth also attracted criminals who brought lawlessness,
    corruption, and crime. Amidst this chaotic backdrop, the Vigilance
    Committees emerged, a phenomenon unique in the annals of American
    history.

    Blog Post Ideas
    The List
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The creative process can be a funny thing. There are times when the
    creativity just flows from me and at other times, not so much. The
    only problem is, I often need to be creative on a schedule but if
    the creative process if fickle and unpredictable what is one to do?
    You capture that creativity when it strikes and make lists that can
    be referred to later when your muse is off doing other things. So
    here is my list of blog topics for future me to write:

    Font Fundamentals
    The Vital Role of Font Choice in Web and Mobile Design
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The fonts you use can have a profound impact on how people will
    remember your website and by extension, your business. Do you use
    ComicSans on your invoices? I'm sure someone out there has done just
    that but most of us know better. But which fonts to use? The options
    seem almost endless. For me, serif fonts convey a air of
    professionalism but at the same time I find them a litte busy to the
    eye. They are supposed to be easier to read (have I been conditioned
    by newspapers?) but most online publications seem to use sanserif
    fonts. What's the deal? As digital experiences continue to evolve,
    the choice of fonts in web and mobile design plays a pivotal role in
    shaping user engagement and readability. The concept of optical
    sizing, a design practice where typefaces are tailored for different
    display sizes, is especially crucial in this context. Let's delve
    into why font choice matters and how you can implement it
    effectively in your designs.

    Encrypt Everything
    Let's Encrypt and the Long Journey to No-Cost SSL
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you've been around the web for as long as I have, you may
    remember when a SSL or “secure cert” could cost a company 00's each
    year just to maintain a valid certificate. Things have changed quite
    a bit since those days. Security is no longer a “nice to have”, it
    is a necessity. But the good news is that it is now free! That's
    right, %%content%%. Zip. Ziltch. Nada. Out of the goodness of their
    corporate hearts and for the greater good of humanity, some of the
    biggest players in Silicon Valley got together and formed something
    called [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) that wants to
    encrypt the entire web.

    Caching Assets
    Service Workers in JavaScript
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We've all been there. You're on your computer, online taking care of
    business. You're just wrapping up the final part of a 6-part online
    job application form and you click submit. The page just spins and
    after a few seconds, you get the dreaded “Network not available”
    screen and all your work is now gone. Sure, browsers have gotten
    better at recovering from these types of scenarios but we need to be
    able to write software that will work, offline or online, if we
    expect users to rely on our web application. Until recently, there
    was little you could do to address the loss of connectivity as there
    was no client-side control mechanism for offline asset caching or
    hooking into network requests. But now there are Service Workers.
    They're perfect for asset caching, which can not only dramatically
    speed up your web apps, but can also make them available offline.
    Don't confuse Service Workers with Web Workers; They are very
    similar but the main difference between the two is that
    Service Workers are persistent while Web Workers are not. In this
    post, I'll walk through setting up a service worker for caching
    assets and explore a couple of different caching strategies.
