    The Vigilance Committees of San Francisco
    -----------------------------------------

    ### Guardians or Vigilantes?

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    San Francisco in the 1850s was a city of stark contrasts. It was a
    burgeoning hub of opportunity following the Gold Rush of 1849,
    attracting fortune-seekers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers. However,
    this rapid growth also attracted criminals who brought lawlessness,
    corruption, and crime. Amidst this chaotic backdrop, the Vigilance
    Committees emerged, a phenomenon unique in the annals of American
    history.

    ### The List

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The creative process can be a funny thing. There are times when the
    creativity just flows from me and at other times, not so much. The
    only problem is, I often need to be creative on a schedule but if
    the creative process if fickle and unpredictable what is one to do?
    You capture that creativity when it strikes and make lists that can
    be referred to later when your muse is off doing other things. So
    here is my list of blog topics for future me to write:

    Font Fundamentals
    -----------------

    ### The Vital Role of Font Choice in Web and Mobile Design

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The fonts you use can have a profound impact on how people will
    remember your website and by extension, your business. Do you use
    ComicSans on your invoices? I'm sure someone out there has done just
    that but most of us know better. But which fonts to use? The options
    seem almost endless. For me, serif fonts convey a air of
    professionalism but at the same time I find them a litte busy to the
    eye. They are supposed to be easier to read (have I been conditioned
    by newspapers?) but most online publications seem to use sanserif
    fonts. What's the deal? As digital experiences continue to evolve,
    the choice of fonts in web and mobile design plays a pivotal role in
    shaping user engagement and readability. The concept of optical
    sizing, a design practice where typefaces are tailored for different
    display sizes, is especially crucial in this context. Let's delve
    into why font choice matters and how you can implement it
    effectively in your designs.

    Encrypt Everything
    ------------------

    ### Let's Encrypt and the Long Journey to No-Cost SSL

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you've been around the web for as long as I have, you may
    remember when a SSL or “secure cert” could cost a company 00's *each
    year* just to maintain a valid certificate. Things have changed
    quite a bit since those days. Security is no longer a “nice to
    have”, it is a necessity. But the good news is that it is now free!
    That's right, %%content%%. Zip. Ziltch. Nada. Out of the goodness of
    their corporate hearts and for the greater good of humanity, some of
    the biggest players in Silicon Valley got together and formed
    something called \[Let's Encrypt\](https://letsencrypt.org) that
    wants to encrypt the entire web.

    As an experienced software engineer with a knack for hands-on tech
    repairs, I recently faced a challenging yet intriguing issue with my
    2015 Mini Cooper S Convertible. The car's \#2 coil pack had not just
    failed once, but twice, and did so quite spectacularly, melting in a
    way that was both baffling and concerning. Determined to get to the
    bottom of this, I embarked on a journey of automotive

    ### Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    JavaScript has come a long way since its inception, continuously
    evolving to meet the demands of modern web development. Two of the
    most exciting additions to the language are the Optional Chaining
    Operator (\`?.\`) and the Nullish Coalescing Operator (\`??\`).
    These operators simplify the way we write code and handle data that
    might be \`undefined\` or \`null\`. Let's dive in and explore these
    operators with some practical examples.

    In the transportation sector, the Internet of Things (IoT) is not
    just a buzzword—it's a fundamental shift in how data is collected,
    analyzed, and utilized to drive decisions. For small fleet
    operators, IoT presents an opportunity to harness big data insights
    that were once the exclusive domain of larger companies with deeper
    pockets. Let's explore how small fleets can leverage IoT to enhance

    JavaScript has come a long way since its inception in 1995. One of
    the most significant leaps in JavaScript's journey has been the
    introduction and widespread adoption of client-side modules. Modules
    have revolutionized how developers structure their code, making it
    more manageable, reusable, and efficient. Let's delve into the
    history, uses, and benefits of client-side JavaScript modules,

    In the dynamic landscape of transportation, small businesses face a
    myriad of challenges, especially when adopting new technologies in
    their fleet operations. While technology offers immense benefits,
    such as increased efficiency and safety, it also brings with it a
    need to navigate complex legal and regulatory frameworks. This is
    particularly relevant in light of the recent federal Department of
    Transportation (DOT) regulations regarding electronic logging.

    success. With drivers scattered across different routes and
    locations, traditional means of communication can fall short. Enter
    the modern era of communication technologies like Voice over
    Internet Protocol (VoIP) and various messaging apps, which have
    become game-changers for managing a mobile workforce.

    Caching Assets
    --------------

    ### Service Workers in JavaScript

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We've all been there. You're on your computer, online taking care of
    business. You're just wrapping up the final part of a 6-part online
    job application form and you click submit. The page just spins and
    after a few seconds, you get the dreaded “Network not available”
    screen and all your work is now gone. Sure, browsers have gotten
    better at recovering from these types of scenarios but we need to be
    able to write software that will work, offline or online, if we
    expect users to rely on our web application. Until recently, there
    was little you could do to address the loss of connectivity as there
    was no client-side control mechanism for offline asset caching or
    hooking into network requests. But now there are Service Workers.
    They're perfect for asset caching, which can not only dramatically
    speed up your web apps, but can also make them available offline.
    Don't confuse `Service Workers` with `Web Workers`; They are very
    similar but the main difference between the two is that
    `Service Workers` are persistent while `Web Workers` are not. In
    this post, I'll walk through setting up a service worker for caching
    assets and explore a couple of different caching strategies.
