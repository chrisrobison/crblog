I hate starting out a new article. I never know how to break the ice; to
get the ball rolling. Once I get started I’m fine. But getting started
can be tough. I get in my head and start overthinking things: “How
technical should I go?”, “Will they be reading this on their phones or
desktop?”, “Will anybody actually read this besides me and my Mom?” or
"Should I start with a joke? But in the end, I usually churn out
something I would turn in to my 11th grade English teacher that I wrote
the night before; a passable attempt but we both know I could do better.
Well, this time I -will- do better, for you dear reader (Hi Mom!). Now
would you look at that. I’m a paragraph in, rambling and very off topic.
Let’s talk fonts. Let’s me start again…

As digital experiences continue to evolve, the choice of fonts in web
and mobile design plays a pivotal role in shaping user engagement and
readability. We now live in a world where we are constantly bombarded
with information. How can you stand out among all the other billboards,
ads, and images? By choosing the right typeface, font and design to
convey *your* message and -engage- your audience. In this article I’ll
give a short history of print and delve into why your font choice can
make all the difference when it comes to getting your message across.

I must admit, when I started to write this post I thought it was going
to be a quick and easy how-to on the use of some of the more modern font
technologies such as variable and color fonts. How wrong I was. As I was
researching and writing the history of the printed word I was astounded
at how deeply influencial the written word has been on the development
of humanity. From the early wide-spread use of pressing reeds into clay
to form cuneiform tablets to the scrolls of ancient Greece and Egypt; to
Gutenberg’s printing press and Martin Luther’s protest nailed to the
door of the Wittenberg Church; to yellow journalism newspapers fanning
the flames of war and the fake news of today, the printed word, by hand
or machine, has had a profound impact on the development of our society.

Well that intro got a lot longer than I was planning but I apparently
have a new passion and respect for fonts and print design. I should
probably break this up into multiple posts. Anyway, we should all
remember the long and arduous journey humanity has taken over the past
3,000 years to get us to where we are today. With a nearly unlimited
array of designs choices to convey our messages and a historically
unprecedented freedom to communicate with nearly anyone else on the
planet at an instant, we need to take seriously how influencial a font
choice can be to getting our message across. I know it sounds a little
silly, but it’s the little things like this that can make all the
differnece. Typography is not just about choosing a pretty typeface;
it’s about communication, readability, and getting the user engaged with
your message.

Font Vocabulary
---------------

The print & design industry have a vocabulary all their own. Western
society has been pressing out books since 1454 (see what I did there?)
and the list of words we use to describe how the print looks on paper
has grown to be quite large. Seemingly similar concepts have subtle
differences (see Legibility vs Readability, Typeface vs Font).

Yet, we use many of these terms everyday; Did you know we get the words
“UPPERCASE” and “lowercase” from the original Movable Type Printing
Press? The UPPERCASE letters were held in the, well in the upper case of
the press. I’ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to guess where the
lowercase letters were stored or is this just an apocryphal story?

I should warn you that I love to make lists. Love. Them. They help me
keep my writing more concise. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I can
get off topic and ramble on pretty easily but I’ve learned to be more
succinct by using lists! So don’t be surprised if you come across a few
lists in my posts. Speaking of lists, here’s a list of some basic
terminology in the world of fonts and print design that I found to be
interesting, confusing, ambiguous or just felt I needed to make note of:

<figure>
<img src="/crblog/assets/img/font-signs/5.png" width="320" alt="" /><figcaption>Moveable type from a printing press</figcaption>
</figure>

1.  **Typeface vs. Font**: A typeface is the design of the lettering
    (e.g., Times New Roman), while a font is a specific style and size
    of that typeface (e.g., Times New Roman, 12pt, Bold).

2.  **Serif vs. Sans Serif**: Serif typefaces, like Times New Roman,
    have small lines at the end of their strokes, while sans-serif
    typefaces, like Arial, do not. Serifs are traditionally seen as more
    formal, while sans-serifs are viewed as modern and clean.

3.  **Legibility vs. Readability**: Legibility refers to how easily
    individual characters can be distinguished, while readability is
    about how easy it is to read and understand blocks of text.

4.  **Hierarchy and Emphasis**: Different fonts and styles (like bold or
    italic) are used to create a hierarchy or to emphasize certain parts
    of the content.

5.  **Sizing & Units**: This starts to get a little out of scope here
    but…I just want to remind everyone that with a little up-front
    planning using responsive design, <span class="citation"
    cites="media-queries">@media-queries</span> and the right relative
    units, the same markup can be used for any screen size or print
    resolution. I am still surprised at the number of companies I still
    see maintaining multiple codebases for desktop and mobile websites.
    With variable fonts and color icon fonts you can make the same
    markup look good from 72dpi to 1200dpi. Down with bitmaps! Long live
    vector graphics!

Key Considerations
------------------

When we need a font, most of us will just scroll through the ‘Font’ menu
until we see a font we like. But for any choice you need to make, you
need to do your due diligence by defining the parameters and constraints
your final choice will need to stay within. The choice of font you use
will be driven by a number of things:

1.  **Target Audience**: The choice of font should resonate with the
    target audience. For example, a children’s app might use a more
    playful font compared to a corporate website.

2.  **Platform**: The platform (web, mobile, app) dictates font choices
    due to varying screen sizes and resolutions.

3.  **Brand Identity**: Fonts should align with the brand’s personality
    – whether it’s formal, friendly, or avant-garde.

4.  **Accessibility**: Consider users with visual impairments. Fonts
    should be legible and sizable to accommodate all users.

5.  **Performance**: Heavier font files can slow down site speed,
    impacting user experience and SEO.

Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s explore the importance of font
choice in web and mobile design, including the innovative world of
variable and color fonts.

Why Font Choice Matters in Digital Design
-----------------------------------------

Font choices in print and web design are crucial for several reasons. I
warned you about the lists:

1.  **User Engagement**: The right font can improve user engagement. A
    well-chosen font can make text more appealing and inviting,
    encouraging visitors to stay longer on a website or read more of a
    printed piece.

2.  **Enhanced Readability**: On smaller screens, fonts with larger
    x-heights and open spacing prevent straining the eyes, making
    content more accessible.

3.  **Tone and Mood Setting**: Fonts can convey different moods and
    tones. For instance, a serif font like Times New Roman might convey
    formality and tradition, suitable for a law firm’s website, while a
    sans-serif font like Arial might feel more modern and informal,
    fitting for a tech startup.

4.  **Brand Identity**: Fonts can be a powerful tool in conveying your
    brand’s personality and values.

5.  **Professionalism and Credibility**: A well-chosen font can enhance
    the professional appearance of a design, lending credibility to the
    content. Poor font choices can have the opposite effect, making a
    design look amateurish.

6.  **Compatibility and Performance**: On the web, font choice can
    affect loading times and compatibility across different devices and
    browsers. Some fonts are optimized for web use and ensure consistent
    rendering across various platforms.

7.  **Adaptability Across Devices**: With an increasing variety of
    screen sizes, from desktops to smartwatches, fonts must be versatile
    and legible across all platforms.

As you can see, fonts are a very important and integral part of how you
communicate with your audience. I must admit, I thought this would be a
quick short blog entry on using color fonts but the more I researched
and wrote, the more I realized how deeply influencial font choices can
be and how underappreciated print design is. Well now that we’ve got the
fundamentals out of the way, let’s get to the good stuff.

Implementing Fonts in Web and Mobile Design
-------------------------------------------

We are going to take a look at how to implement this in practice using
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), a popular and versatile
repository of fonts provided by Google that are free to use. They
provide a variety of styles including some very convicing handwriting
fonts.

### HTML/CSS Example with Google Fonts

First, choose a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). For
this example, we’ll use ‘Roboto’, a highly legible sans serif font for
web and mobile interfaces, ‘Noto Serif’, a very legible serif font and
pair those with ‘Shadows Into Light’ as a companion font. Feel free to
look through Google’s font collection and pick your own.

Let’s take a look at that markup:

#### HTML

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Serif:wght@300&family=Roboto:wght@300;400;700&family=Shadows+Into+Light&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
        <title>Font Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Heading Styled with Roboto</h1>
        <p>This paragraph is styled with Roboto, optimized for readability.</p>
        <p class='serif'>Good font combinations <span class='cursive'>Emphasize</span> the right words..</p>
    </body>
    </html>

#### CSS

    body {
        font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    }

    h1 {
        font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
        font-size: 2em; /* Larger size for headings */
        font-weight: 700; /* Bolder weight for impact */
    }

    p {
        font-size: 1em; /* Standard size for body text */
        font-weight: 400; /* Regular weight for readability */
    }

    .serif {
        font-family: 'Noto Serif', serif;
        font-size: 1rem;
        width: 80rem;
        border-radius: 1rem;
        height: 4rem;
        background-color: #ccc;
    }

    .cursive {
        font-family: 'Shadows Into Light', cursive;
        font-size: 1.2rem;
    }

#### Result

The Future with Variable and Color Fonts
----------------------------------------

### Variable Fonts

Variable fonts represent a significant advancement in digital
typography. They allow a single font file to behave like multiple fonts,
offering a range of styles, weights, and widths. This is particularly
beneficial in web and mobile design for several reasons:

1.  **Efficiency**: A single variable font file can replace multiple
    font files, reducing load times and improving website performance.

2.  **Flexibility**: Designers can fine-tune the style, weight, or width
    of the font dynamically, offering greater creative control over
    typography.

3.  **Improved User Experience**: They allow for real-time adjustment of
    fonts according to user preferences or device characteristics,
    enhancing accessibility.

<figure>
<img src="/crblog/assets/img/variable.svg" style="width:100.0%" alt="" /><figcaption><em>Variations can be combined. The first example has a light weight and body-like optical size; the second has a heavy weight and display-like optical size (note the higher contrast); the third also has a similarly heavy weight, but with a body-like optical size.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

Using a variable font is as easy as using a normal, non-variable font.
The only difference is the size of the variable font file can be quite a
bit larger as they must store more information for each character.
Something to keep in mind if you are targeting mobile users or users
with slow connections. Here’s how you can implement a variable font
using Google Fonts:

#### HTML

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Flex&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
        <title>Font Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Heading Styled with Roboto</h1>
        <p>This paragraph is also styled with Roboto, optimized for readability.</p>
    </body>
    </html>

#### CSS

    body {
        font-family: 'Roboto Flex', sans-serif;
        font-variation-settings: 'wght' 400, 'wdth' 100;
    }

    h1 {
        font-size: 2em; /* Larger size for headings */
        font-weight: 700; /* Bolder weight for impact */
    }

    p {
        font-size: 1em; /* Standard size for body text */
        font-weight: 400; /* Regular weight for readability */
    }

![](/crblog/assets/img/roboto-flex.png)

As you can see, implementing a variable font is identical to using a
normal font, we just update the font to download and change the CSS to
reflect the new font name. If anything, it’s even easier as we do not
need to specify each weight and varient we want to use when we include
our external font. They are all included in the variable font. So in
this example, you can adjust the `wght` and `wdth` associated with
‘Roboto Flex’ to change how the weight and width axes are rendered. You
can adjust these values throughout your CSS to suit your design needs.

Color Fonts

### Uses and Abuses

<figure>

</figure>

I love color fonts. There are some purists out there that feel text
should only be a single color, black. They cite readability concerns and
start mumbling something about [Edward
Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/) and <span
style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:bold;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">ComicSans</span>.
But color fonts, also known as chromatic fonts, are the latest
innovation in typography and they bring the richness of color and
texture into text. While this opens up new possibilities for branding
and design, allowing fonts to include multiple colors, gradients, and
even textures it also provides opportunity for creating designs that are
busy and difficult to read. In web design, color fonts can be used to:

1.  **Enhance Branding**: Color fonts can include brand colors and
    textures, making text an integral part of the brand identity.

2.  **Improve Visual Interest**: They add a new dimension to typography,
    making it more visually appealing.

3.  **Create Consistent Aesthetics**: Using color fonts can ensure
    consistent color schemes across different platforms.

4.  **Provide icons for UI or social networks**: Including icons in a
    font in nothing new (see [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)),
    color fonts allow us to go a step further and create our own bespoke
    fonts containing all the social service and user interface icons we
    need for our site or application.

### How They Work

A color font file is actually just a regular font file that embeds
additional data to display more graphic properties than the contour
shapes of a character.

Color fonts are now generally stored as SVG data inside OpenType font
files. This SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format can hold vector shapes
with color or gradients, and may also include bitmap images - thus
leading to bitmap fonts.

On top of all this, While doing research for this article I discovered
that color fonts are now officially referred as **OpenType-SVG fonts**.

You’re probably thinking how simple, straightfoward and level-headed
this all sounds. Nothing but sunshine and rainbow fonts. Right?

Well, the reality is a bit more complex…

### Time For Some History

The OpenType-SVG font format was initially designed by Mozilla & Adobe
and became an industry standard in early 2016, when other big players
including Microsoft & Google agreed on a single format to support color
fonts.

All of them (including Apple) have previously developed and implemented
their own proprietary color formats to display emojis on their operating
systems, while many other companies built other custom color font
technologies for the gaming, video or print industries.

There are now four major color font formats that fit into regular font
files: SBIX, COLR, CBDT and SVG, each having it own specificities. Read
the full story [here](https://pixelambacht.nl/2014/multicolor-fonts/) or
check out my simplified recap:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>Vector</th>
<th>Bitmap</th>
<th>Native support</th>

<tr class="odd">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Due to the differences and incompatibilities of these formats, the
design industry is going through a transition period during which
several color font formats may be needed to ensure cross-platform
compatibility across several operating systems, browsers and apps.

But OpenType-SVG seems in great position to become a golden standard now
that **three operating systems support OpenType-SVG fonts**: Windows 10,
macOS Mojave, and iOS 12.

A solution to mitigate this issue on legacy software? Color fonts can
also include some alternate **vector shape data as a fallback solution**
for software that do not (yet) support any of the embedded color
formats.

What’s the Catch?
-----------------

### File size

<figure>
<img src="/crblog/assets/img/font-signs/5.png" width="600" alt="" /><figcaption>Moveable type from an early printing press</figcaption>
</figure>

So as you’ve probably guessed by now, there are drawbacks to color
fonts. The biggest one is filesize (see what I did there?). A color font
file is generally larger than a regular font file, and a lot more so
when the font embeds high-resolution bitmap characters.

Whereas fonts usually weigh 10-100 kilobytes, color vector fonts can
reach 100KB to 2MB+ depending on their visual complexity.

Color bitmap fonts may range from a few megabytes to tens of megabytes,
and sizes increase when multiple color font formats are embedded in a
single file.

### Implementation

Implementing color fonts can be as simple as using them in your CSS,
similar to regular fonts. However, it’s important to ensure
compatibility, as support for color fonts can vary across different
browsers and devices. Color fonts hijack a feature for rendering of
diacritic marks, such as umlauts (¨), over vowels in order to render
multiple layers of charaters over each other in order to achieve the
effect. Just be sure to test thoroughly in all your potential
environments to ensure proper rendering when using color fonts.

Final Thoughts
--------------

The world of web and mobile typography is becoming more vibrant and
alive with the advent of these latest font capabilities. These
innovations offer designers unprecedented flexibility and creative
possibilities, making it an exciting time to be in web and mobile
design. As always, the key is to balance creativity with functionality,
ensuring that your design choices enhance the user experience. The right
font choice is key to creating an engaging and accessible digital
experience. By considering optical sizing and using tools like Google
Fonts, designers can craft visually appealing and functional web and
mobile interfaces. Remember, typography is not just about making words
readable; it’s about bringing content to life.
