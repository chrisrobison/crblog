Realtime Black Lists
Introduction
In the ceaseless battle against spam, Realtime Black Lists (RBLs) have
emerged as a potent weapon. A RBL contains lists of email servers,
domain names, and IP addresses that are associated with hosting,
producing, forwarding or otherwise contributing to creating spam. Email
servers can reference these lists to determine if an email is being from
a “spammer” host and flagging or denying the message.
Gathering Intel
The RBL services use a number of methods to compile lists of IP
addresses reputed to send spam, mostly by using honeypots. Honeypots are
basically email servers setup to accept mail to “poison” email addresses
that have been seeded in the wild by various means but it doesn’t take
much more than simply listing an email address on a web page for the
spam to start flowing. If a honeypot receives any messages to a
“poisoned” email, that sender is a spammer and they are added to the
RBL. Other ways to get added to the RBL include being reported or having
an insecure or improperly configured server (open relays, etc.).
How RBLs Work
RBLs leverage the DNS service; normally known for looking up IP
addresses for domain names. A suspected spamming domain is added to the
RBLs DNS as host entry. This makes it incredibly simple to check if a
domain or IP address is in the RBL using a normal DNS lookup; if a
record is returned, they are are spammer and you can “blackhole” or
otherwise handle the message as having a high probability of being spam.
https://www.dnsbl.info/ has a good short explanation and history of the
technology.
But like any tool, RBLs come with their own set of pros and cons so
let’s dive into why they’re both a blessing and a curse and what happens
when a once trusted RBL turns bad.
The Benefits
Here’s a quick rundown of the benefits of using an RBL:
1.  Efficient Filtering
    The most obvious benefit of RBLs is their ability to efficiently
    filter out spam. By cross-referencing incoming emails with a list of
    known spam IPs, email servers can quickly identify and block
    unwanted messages.
2.  Resource Savings
    Spam filtering can be resource-intensive. RBLs help to alleviate
    this by providing a quick way to reject spam before it even enters
    the system, saving both computational power and storage space.
3.  Community-Driven
    Many RBLs are maintained by communities of volunteers or
    organizations dedicated to internet security. This collective effort
    often results in highly accurate and up-to-date lists.
4.  Flexible
    RBLs can be customized to suit the specific needs of an
    organization. You can choose to implement multiple lists, or even
    create your own based on the spam you encounter.
The Drawbacks
There are always two sides to every coin, so let’s take a look at some
of drawbacks of RBLs:
1.  False Positives
    The most glaring issue with RBLs is the potential for false
    positives. Legitimate emails can sometimes be flagged and blocked,
    which can lead to missed opportunities or strained relationships.
2.  Lack of Due Process
    Once an IP is blacklisted, it can be challenging to get it removed,
    especially if the RBL is not well-maintained. This can be
    particularly problematic for dynamic IPs, which may be reassigned to
    innocent users.
3.  Potential for Abuse
    RBLs can be weaponized to block competitors or dissenting voices.
    Even worse is when an RBL goes bad as I discuss further a bit later.
    While neither of these are common, the potential for abuse exists.
Renegade RBL Providers: The UCEPROTECT Case
While RBLs generally aim to make the digital world a safer place, not
all providers play by the same rules. Some, like UCEPROTECT, have
garnered controversy for their aggressive tactics. The following are
some of the tactics UCEPROTECT uses to extort money from innocent sevice
providers:
1.  Broad Strokes: Blocking Entire Subnets
    UCEPROTECT is known for blocking entire subnets instead of
    individual IPs, a practice that can cause significant collateral
    damage. This “guilty by association” approach can result in the
    blocking of numerous innocent users who happen to share a subnet
    with a spam source.
2.  Pay-to-Play: The Delisting Dilemma
    What sets UCEPROTECT apart from most other RBLs is their requirement
    for payment to expedite delisting. This has led to accusations of
    operating more like a “ransom” service than a legitimate security
    tool. While they argue that the fee is a deterrent against spammers,
    critics claim it’s a revenue-generating scheme that exploits those
    desperate to restore their online reputation.
3.  Ethical Concerns
    Such practices raise ethical questions about the role and governance
    of RBL providers. Should they be allowed to hold such sway over
    online communications, especially when their actions can affect
    innocent parties? And should delisting ever be a paid service, or
    should it be based solely on the merit of the case?
Final Thoughts
The case of UCEPROTECT serves as a cautionary tale in the use of RBLs.
While these lists can be incredibly useful, it’s crucial to consider the
source and their practices. Always do your due diligence when choosing
an RBL provider, and be aware that some may come with ethical and
practical complications that could do more harm than good.
Realtime Black Lists offer a powerful means of filtering out spam,
saving resources, and leveraging community knowledge for better
security. However, they are not without their flaws, such as the
potential for false positives and abuse. Like any tool, the key to using
RBLs effectively lies in understanding their limitations and remembering
that not all RBLs are created equal. Choose wisely, and keep an eye out
for those that might be playing fast and loose with your online
security.
