San Francisco has earned a reputation as a world-class haunted city.
With it’s beginnings as a gold rush town through today’s technology
boom, The City’s tumultuous past has lured many tortured souls to
remain. This is my personal list of haunted or spooky places in San
Francisco that you don’t usually see in other lists. This list is by no
means exhaustive, just some places and stories I have found to be spooky
and interesting.

-   **[Sutro
    Baths](https://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/historyculture/sutro-baths.htm)**:

    The tunnel/cave carved into the rockface at the former location of
    the Sutro Baths at Lands End is rumored to have any number of
    ghosts, demons or sea creatures that leave large claw marks
    scratched into the rock. There is also an urban legend that if you
    take a lit candle to the northern end of the tunnel, an unseen force
    will take the candle and launch it into the surf below.

    Address: 1004 Point Lobos Ave

-   **[Sutro
    Park/Forest](https://www.outsidelands.org/sutro-ghosts.php)**:

    Between 1899 and 1908 a large number of bodies that were apparent
    suicides were discovered in Sutro Forest. It is said that many of
    these tortured souls can be seen wandering the grounds wearing
    Victorian dress on foggy, moonlit nights.

    Address: 155 Johnstone Dr

-   **[Broderick/Terry Dual, Lake
    Merced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broderick%E2%80%93Terry_duel)**:

    Senator David C. Broderick was an ambitious political climber and an
    outspoken abolitionist in the Democratic Party. His buddy,
    California Chief Justice David S. Terry (who was known for getting
    into fights and shanking people), on the other hand, was a staunch
    supporter of slavery and advocated for its extension into
    California. When Terry lost re-election in 1859, he blamed Broderick
    for engineering the loss and challenged him to a duel on the edge of
    Lake Merced with the idea that whoever was left standing would win
    the argument of whether or not California should have slavery.

    Both pistols had hair triggers, but it was Broderick’s that
    discharged prior to the final count. He just had to stand there
    while Terry took an easy aim at him and fired, hitting his lung.
    Broderick was taken back to the home of his friend Leonidas Haskell,
    where he languished in pain for three days until he died.

    This event became known as the “Last Duel in California,” or the
    “Last Notable American Dual”. Broderick would become a martyr for
    the anti-slavery movement. Both the location of the dual near Lake
    Merced and the Haskell House are said to be haunted by shadowy
    figures flashing lights and tipping plants over.

    Address: 1100 Lake Merced Blvd

-   **[Mary Ellen
    Pleasant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ellen_Pleasant)**:

    Mary Ellen Pleasant was a former slave and indentured servant who
    came to San Francisco in 1899. She eventually opened up a restaurant
    and was notorious for clandestinely picking up stock tips from the
    wealthy businessmen who ate there. She was so savvy that she used
    these tips to make herself rich, eventually designing and building a
    bitchin’ mansion on Octavia Street. She lived there with her
    business partner and his wife. Things got a little scandalous when
    Pleasant was accused of pushing her business partner down the stairs
    and killing him. Eventually she was pressured to move out of San
    Francisco, lost all her savings, and died years later. It is said
    that her spirit haunts the commemorative park on Octavia and Bush
    St. If you stand on the plaque and make a polite request it will be
    granted. Beware, though, rumor has it that she throws rocks on the
    heads of people who do not show her the proper respect.

    1501 Octavia St

-   **[St. Francis
    Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westin_St._Francis)**:

    It is widely believed that the famous celebrities of Hollywood have
    been haunting Union Square’s St. Francis Hotel for years. The hotel
    was the place where the yesteryear actor John Barrymore died in an
    earthquake that struck San Francisco in the year 1906, as the actor
    was sleeping in one of the hotel rooms. Another story is about a
    party that was held in suites 1219 and 1221 by Fatty Arbuckle, a
    silent-movie comedian. This grand party apparently got out of
    control, which led to the rape and murder of Virginia Rappe, an
    American model and silent film actress. Al Jolson, an American
    singer, comedian, stage and film actor also died in the same suite
    during a poker game in the year 1950. The hotel staff and hotel
    guests have reported that they have sensed and felt Barrymore’s,
    Arbuckle’s and Jolson’s spirits in the hallways of the hotel.

    Powell St, Union Square

-   **[The Pinecrest Diner
    Murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinecrest_Diner)**:

    The Pinecrest Diner sits on the corner of Mason and Geary. The sign
    above the door boasts “Best breakfast in San Francisco” and it’s a
    good little greasy spoon. However, patrons will notice that the
    breakfast menu has an odd addendum on it: no poached eggs. This
    seemingly innocuous detail hints at a murder that took place at the
    diner back in the late 90’s. In 1997, Hashem Zayed, a cook at the
    Pinecrest, shot and killed a waitress. Rumor has it that earlier
    that week the waitress, Helen Menicou, had scolded Zayed for making
    off-menu poached eggs for a customer. According to the story, Zayed
    was so upset and embarrassed he stayed up all night and returned to
    work the next morning bedraggled and armed. Zayed never admitted
    explicitly that the eggs were the cause of his crime, but the
    restaurant refuses to serve them to this day.

    401 Geary St

-   **[The Lady of Stow
    Lake](https://goldengatepark.com/stow-lake-ghost.html)**:

    There are several origin stories concerning the apparition known as
    the [Stow Lake
    Ghost](https://goldengatepark.com/stow-lake-ghost.html). Some say
    she was an absentminded mother wandering Golden Gate Park’s Stow
    Lake with a baby in a stroller. She became so enthralled in a
    conversation that the stroller rolled into the lake, at which point
    the woman panicked and jumped in after her baby, swimming and
    searching until both mother and child drowned. Another story says
    she was an unwed teen who jumped into the lake and drowned herself
    to hide her illicit pregnancy. Either way the legends claim that a
    white figure of the woman can be seen wandering the lake shore at
    night. A related myth claims that the nearby Pioneer Woman and
    Children statue will move its stone face to a different position
    when the ghost is nearby.

    Stow Lake, Golden Gate Park

-   **Former President of the USA Warren G. Harding’s Place of Death and
    Possible Ghost**:

    Officially, President Warren G. Harding died at the Palace Hotel of
    a heart attack but legend has it that he actually died at a bar
    located across the street from the Palace Hotel and was transported
    back to the hotel via an underground tunnel linking the tavern with
    the hotel. The reason for the cover-up was that Harding was
    President right smack dab in the middle of prohibition, even though
    it was well known that the President liked to imbibe now and again.
    The bar still exists and is called the “House of Shields” and they
    have a large portrait of the former President hanging on their
    walls. Guests staying at the Palace Hotel have reported seeing
    Harding’s ghost roaming the halls of the hotel.

    2 New Montgomery St

-   **[Presidio Pet
    Cemetery](https://www.nps.gov/places/000/presidio-pet-cemetery.htm)**:

    The final resting place for hundreds of animals owned by families
    that were stationed at the Presidio, the pet cemetery dates back to
    the 1950s. According to the National Park Service, there are no
    official records for the site, meaning it probably began with the
    families themselves, with authorization from one of the commanding
    officers.

    667 McDowell Ave, Presidio

-   **[The Wave Organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Organ)**:

    On a small jetty that extends from behind the Golden Gate Yacht Club
    at the end of Marina Green, is a “[wave
    organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Organ)” that was
    constructed from stone salvaged from the demolition of Laurel Hill
    Cemetery in San Francisco. This “instrument” has cement tubes that
    extend into the water and as the wave push water in and out of these
    tubes, they create haunting sounds. The structure is dedicated to
    Frank Oppenheimer as this was his final project before he died. This
    place is definitely haunted.

    1 Yacht Rd (walk to end of jetty)

-   **[Whittier Mansion](https://noehill.com/sf/landmarks/sf075.asp)**:

    William Franklin Whittier, a railroad magnate, built this 30-room
    mansion in 1894 as a gift to his wife. Unfortunately, she was never
    able to live in it as she died in a carriage accident before it was
    completed. He died in the home years later of natural causes, and
    his son Billy, known for being a slacker and very into partying,
    sold it in the 1930s to the German Reich. It operated as the German
    Consulate from 1938 to 1941, when it is alleged that it housed
    German spies. It was seized by the U.S. Alien Property Custodian in
    1941 due to WWII, used by the California Historical Society as their
    headquarters for a short time, and is now a private residence once
    again. And though one doesn’t necessarily need to begrudge anyone
    who wants to live in a home with over 30 rooms, just in case one
    does, they can take satisfaction in knowing that the home has been
    said to be haunted by all sorts of ghosts. Some say it’s the German
    spies. Some say it is Billy who haunts the wine cellar, hoping to
    get his hands on just one more bottle of wine, and perhaps saddest
    of all, some say they have seen a shadowy figure who is thought to
    be the ghost of William Whittier, still waiting for his wife to join
    him in the house she was never able to call home.

    1990 California St

-   **[Moss Creek Distillery, Moss
    Creek](https://mossbeachdistillery.com/history-ghost/)**:

    Moss Creek is located on the coast a few miles south of San
    Francisco. According to the ghostly legend of “The Blue Lady” in
    1912 a beautiful, young woman met by chance a handsome, dangerous
    man and fell in love with him. This dapper ladies’ man was
    reportedly a piano player in the bar. The young woman, who would
    always dress in blue, was already married to another but her
    unsuspecting husband never knew of the illicit affair. She made many
    trips to the restaurant to be with her lover. The beautiful lady in
    blue was killed while walking on the beach below the restaurant with
    her lover. The couple were assaulted on the beach where they both
    sustained serious injuries. The Lady in Blue succumbed to her
    injuries before help could arrive but her lover ended up surviving.
    Visitors have reported seeing many telltale signs of the Lady in
    Blue, from ghostly blue apparitions to swinging lamps and stacked
    glasses. Some say she is still trying to recapture the romance and
    excitement of her love affair to this day. The distillery has had
    many strange occurrences and has even been featured on *Unsolved
    Mysteries* and *Ghost Hunters*.

    140 Beach Way, Moss Beach, CA 94038
