Game Name: Urban QuestAR
Concept:
Urban QuestAR is an augmented reality (AR) mobile game that encourages
exploration, interaction, and engagement with the urban environment. It
is designed with the commuting office worker in mind, it is similar to
Pokémon Go, in that it integrates the digital and physical worlds,
provides game challenges and quests but also with a focus on urban
exploration and social interaction. The general idea is that once you
install the game on your phone, you will be presented with challenges
via the app, SMS messages, voicemails, etc. The challenges or quests
will involve using your phone’s camera to view an augmented reality
overlay of game objects over the real world. As an example, you may
receive a challenge to ride BART to Powell Street station and scan a QR
code sticker another player put there as their quest. As you move around
the city, you can scan your AR surroundings to find coins, gems,
coupons, etc.
Gameplay Mechanics:
1.  Collecting Gems/Coins: Players explore their city to find and
    collect digital gems or coins placed in various locations. These
    items are visible only through the AR interface of the game.
2.  Dynamic Quests: Players receive quests that require them to visit
    specific locations, like landmarks, parks, or lesser-known spots in
    the city. Quests can vary from simple check-ins to more complex
    tasks like solving riddles or puzzles based on the surroundings.
3.  Photo Challenges: Some quests involve taking specific photos, like a
    unique street art piece or a historic building, which then becomes a
    part of a larger collection or puzzle within the game.
4.  Player-Generated Content: Players can create their own quests by
    placing QR codes or digital markers in locations for others to find.
    Completing these player-generated quests yields higher rewards.
5.  Social Interaction and Teams: Players can join forces to complete
    more challenging quests. The game encourages forming teams for
    certain tasks, promoting social interaction both digitally and in
    person.
6.  Transport-Based Quests: Incorporating public transportation, quests
    might require players to ride a bus or train to reach a destination,
    encouraging exploration of new areas.
7.  Event-Based Challenges: Special events or challenges that occur
    during festivals, holidays, or specific days, adding variety and
    keeping the game fresh.
8.  Leaderboards and Rewards: Leaderboards for individual players and
    teams, along with a reward system for completing quests and
    challenges. Rewards could include virtual items, enhanced game
    abilities, or even real-world perks like discounts at local
    businesses.
9.  Free-for-All: Hold events where large quantities of coins and gems
    are placed in a general areas, such as 100 diamonds circling Union
    Square, one diamond per player. First come, first served.
Real-World Integration:
-   Local Business Partnerships: Collaborate with local businesses to
    place quests or special items, driving foot traffic to their
    locations.

    integrate digital objects into the real world.

    accurate location-based gameplay.
-   Privacy and Safety: Strong focus on privacy and safety, ensuring
    player data is secure and gameplay doesn’t lead players into unsafe
    situations.
Monetization Strategy:

    quests.

Conclusion
Urban QuestAR aims to combine the fun of a mobile game with the
adventure of urban exploration, fostering community engagement and
