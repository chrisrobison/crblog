JavaScript has come a long way since its inception, continuously
evolving to meet the demands of modern web development. Two of the most
exciting additions to the language are the Optional Chaining Operator
(?.) and the Nullish Coalescing Operator (??). These operators simplify
the way we write code and handle data that might be undefined or null.
Let’s dive in and explore these operators with some practical examples.
Optional Chaining Operator (?.)
Gone are the days of verbose and repetitive checks to avoid the dreaded
TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined. The Optional Chaining
Operator allows us to read the value of a property located deep within a
chain of connected objects without having to explicitly validate each
reference in the chain.
Syntax:
    obj?.prop       // Accessing a property
    obj?.[expr]     // Accessing a property with an expression
    func?.(...args) // Calling a function if it exists
Code Example:
    const user = {
      profile: {
        name: 'Chris',
        details: {
          age: 30,
          hobbies: ['Golf', 'Karaoke'],
        },
      },
    };
    // Traditional way
    const userHobbies = user.profile ? user.profile.details ? user.profile.details.hobbies : null : null;
    // With Optional Chaining
    const userHobbies = user?.profile?.details?.hobbies;
    console.log(userHobbies); // Output: ['Golf', 'Karaoke']
In the above example, if any part of the chain is undefined or null, the
expression short-circuits and returns undefined instead of throwing an
error.
Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)
The Nullish Coalescing Operator is a logical operator that returns its
right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or
undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand. This is
particularly useful for assigning default values.
Syntax:
    leftExpr ?? rightExpr
Code Example:
    const settings = {
      theme: null,
      fontSize: undefined,
    };
    // Traditional way with logical OR operator (||)
    const theme = settings.theme || 'dark'; // 'dark' would be the default if settings.theme is falsy
    const fontSize = settings.fontSize || 'medium'; // 'medium' would be the default if settings.fontSize is falsy
    // With Nullish Coalescing Operator
    const theme = settings.theme ?? 'dark';
    const fontSize = settings.fontSize ?? 'medium';
    console.log(theme); // Output: 'dark'
    console.log(fontSize); // Output: 'medium'
The key difference between ?? and || is that ?? does not consider empty
strings or the number 0 as nullish values, while || does.
Combining Both Operators
These operators can be combined to provide very concise and readable
code when dealing with complex data structures.
Code Example:
    const config = {
      header: {
        title: 'New JavaScript Features'
      }
    };
    const title = config.header?.title ?? 'Default Title';
    console.log(title); // Output: 'New JavaScript Features'
In this example, if config.header is undefined, the title would default
to 'Default Title'.
Now let’s delve a bit deeper into the difference between using the
Nullish Coalescing Operator (??) and the Logical OR operator (||) to
understand their distinct behaviors.
Truthy vs. Nullish
The Logical OR (||) operator has been used in JavaScript for a long time
to provide default values. It works based on the truthiness of the
expressions. In JavaScript, false, 0, '' (empty string), null,
undefined, and NaN are all falsy values. Everything else is truthy. If
the left-hand operand is falsy, || will return the right-hand operand.
On the other hand, the Nullish Coalescing Operator (??) is more
specific. It only checks for null or undefined. It doesn’t care about
the other falsy values like 0 or ''.
Code Comparison:
    // Let's assume we have an object that holds settings for a user's profile.
    const profileSettings = {
      theme: '', // An empty string, meaning the user wants no theme.
      notifications: 0, // The user has turned off notifications.
    };
    // Using Logical OR (||)
    const theme = profileSettings.theme || 'dark'; // 'dark' is the default
    const notifications = profileSettings.notifications || 10; // 10 is the default
    console.log(theme); // Output: 'dark' (not what the user intended)
    console.log(notifications); // Output: 10 (not what the user intended)
    // Using Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)
    const themeCorrect = profileSettings.theme ?? 'dark';
    const notificationsCorrect = profileSettings.notifications ?? 10;
    console.log(themeCorrect); // Output: '' (exactly what the user intended)
    console.log(notificationsCorrect); // Output: 0 (exactly what the user intended)
In the above example, the Logical OR (||) fails to respect the user’s
choice of an empty string for theme and 0 for notifications because they
are falsy values. It defaults to the provided fallbacks even though the
user has made a clear choice.
The Nullish Coalescing Operator (??), however, correctly identifies that
the user has set values (even though they are falsy) and doesn’t
override them with the defaults.
The choice between using || or ?? should be made based on whether you
need to provide a fallback for any falsy value (||) or specifically for
null or undefined (??). Understanding this distinction is crucial for
writing precise and bug-free code, especially when dealing with
configurations, settings, or any data that could intentionally have
falsy values other than null or undefined.
Conclusion
The Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing operators are excellent
examples of JavaScript’s evolution. They offer cleaner, more intuitive
ways to handle data that may not always be present, and they can prevent
many common errors in code. As browser support for these features
becomes ubiquitous, they’re quickly becoming indispensable tools in the
modern JavaScript developer’s toolkit.
Remember, while these operators can make your code more concise, clarity
should never be sacrificed for brevity. Use these tools wisely to write
code that’s not only clever but also maintainable and easy to
understand.
