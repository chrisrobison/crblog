If you’ve been around the web for as long as I have, you may remember
when a SSL or “secure cert” could cost a company thousands of dollars
*each year* just to maintain a valid certificate. Things have changed
quite a bit since those days. Security is no longer a “nice to have”, it
is a necessity. But the good news is that it is now free! That’s right,
$0. Zip. Ziltch. Out of the goodness of their hearts and for the greater
good, some of the biggest players in Silicon Valley got together and
formed something called [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).

What is Let’s Encrypt?
----------------------

[Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) is a free, automated, and open
Certificate Authority (CA) launched in April 2016. It’s a project of the
[Internet Security Research Group
(ISRG)](https://www.abetterinternet.org/), backed by major companies
like [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org/), [Cisco](https://cisco.com/),
[Akamai](https://akamai.com), [Google
Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and
[Facebook](https://facebook.com/). The primary goal of Let’s Encrypt is
to make encrypted connections on the web ubiquitous and easy to set up.

### The Backers and Goals

The backing by industry giants provides Let’s Encrypt with the necessary
resources and credibility. These companies have a shared interest in
making the web more secure and privacy-respecting. The goal of Let’s
Encrypt is simple yet ambitious: to encrypt the entire web, making HTTPS
the default web protocol.

### Why HTTPS?

Switching to HTTPS not only secures the data between your website and
its users but also boosts your SEO rankings, as search engines like
Google favor secure sites. It also gives your visitors confidence,
knowing their data is protected. And best of all, it’s free and they
have made it dead simple to setup in almost any environment.

### Upgrading to HTTPS with Certbot

Certbot is a free, open-source software tool for automatically using
Let’s Encrypt certificates on manually-administered websites to enable
HTTPS. It’s developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and is
designed to simplify the process of setting up and maintaining an HTTPS
server. Certbot isn’t the only tool for working with Let’s Encrypt’s
ACMEv2 protocol, they provide a great [list of ACMEv2
clients](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/) for a variety of
languages and environments.

We’re going to stick with certbot since it does everything we need.
Certbot can automatically upgrade/update most server configurations and
supports a variety of web servers such as Apache and nginx. Site
verification can be handled automatically by certbot or you can verify
manually using DNS or by placing a file in your servers document tree.

Now that we’ve got the what, who, and why out of the way, let’s actually
set up HTTPS for a basic Apache installation.

### Step-by-Step Guide

This ia a basic guide to get you started with Certbot. They make this
either very simple or very difficult depending on your setup. The more
standard your setup, the more likely it will work out of the box. Note
that you’ll need shell access to your web server and appropriate
permissions to execute commands.

1.  **Install Certbot**: The first step is to install Certbot. The
    installation method varies depending on your server’s operating
    system but certbot is included in most package managers. For a Linux
    server running Debian, you would use:

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install certbot

2.  **Choose Your Web Server and Operating System**: Go to the [Certbot
    website](https://certbot.eff.org/) and select your web server and
    operating system for tailored instructions.

3.  **Get and Install Your Certificates**: To setup and configure
    Apache, run Certbot with the following command, replacing
    `your_domain` with your actual domain name:

        sudo certbot --apache -d your_domain.com -d www.your_domain.com

    This command will run Certbot with the `--apache` plugin, using `-d`
    to specify the domains. Change the plugin\[s\] being used based on
    your server and configuration. You can get a list of available
    plugins by running:

        sudo certbot plugins

4.  **Test Automatic Renewal**: Let’s Encrypt certificates are valid for
    90 days. Test the automatic renewal process with:

        sudo certbot renew --dry-run

5.  **Set Up Auto-Renewal**: You can set up a cron job or a systemd
    timer for automatic renewal.

6.  **Verify HTTPS**: Once installed, visit your website with `https://`
    to ensure everything is working correctly.

### Final Thoughts

Switching to HTTPS is no longer a matter of choice but a necessity in
the modern web. With tools like Let’s Encrypt and Certbot, this
transition becomes accessible to everyone, regardless of budget. It’s a
small step for a single website but a giant leap towards a more secure
and trustworthy internet.

Remember, the web is a shared resource, and we all have a part in
keeping it safe and accessible. Happy encrypting!
