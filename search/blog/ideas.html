Background
----------

The creative process can be a funny thing. There are times when the
creativity just flows from me and at other times, not so much. The only
problem is, I often need to be creative on a schedule but if the
creative process if fickle and unpredictable what is one to do? You
capture that creativity when it strikes and make lists that can be
referred to later when your muse is off doing other things. So here is
my list of blog topics for future me to write:

San Francisco History
---------------------

I’ve lived in San Francisco for nearly 30 years and during my time here,
I have become something of a San Francisco historian. I love taking
people on tours and showing them things they never knew existed.
Everyone who visits sees the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and
Fisherman’s Wharf. But did you know that there is a hidden Rainbow
Waterfall in Golden Gate Park? Or a hidden cross on the cliff above it.
Or that there was an observatory near that same location, on Strawberry
Hill? Or that the Pony Express’s final stop was in the Financial
District? Or what about the Barbary Coast? Or the House of Shields, a
bar a former president died in right in the middle of prohibition. My
tales of San Francisco history are as wild and colorful as the old west
from which they were born. Now I’ve got myself excited about these
topics. I need to get started writing these!
