I was recently watching some [YouTube](https://youtube.com) videos on
ancient petroglyphs and rock art around California and the southwest and
it got me thinking. The similarities between many of the figures from
various sites separated by great distances is striking. A bit online
research informed me that other people have also noticed these
similarities and apparently this imagery is not limited to North America
but can be found all over the world! What's going on here?

My theory is that there was a global catastrophic event in antiquity
linking ancient rock art to aurora borealis-like phenomena through
Birkeland Currents and
[z-pinches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-pinch). It's a compelling
idea that could potentially explain the similarities in ancient art
across different cultures and geographical locations.

Here's my theory:

### The "Global Aurora Theory"

#### Premise:

Around 12,000 years ago, Earth experienced an unusually high level of
solar activity, resulting in global auroras far more vivid and frequent
than what we see today. These auroras were not confined to the polar
regions but were visible across the globe due to a stronger and more
fluctuating magnetosphere.

#### Mechanism:

1.  **Solar Flares & Birkeland Currents**: Increased solar activity led
    to stronger solar winds, which interacted with Earth's magnetic
    field. This created Birkeland Currents that were far more intense
    and reached lower latitudes.

2.  **Z-Pinches**: These currents occasionally underwent z-pinch
    phenomena, creating bright, localized, and complex light patterns in
    the sky.

3.  **Ionospheric Changes**: The heightened solar activity also led to
    changes in the ionosphere, making it more conducive to colorful and
    complex auroras.

#### Cultural Impact:

1.  **Spiritual Significance**: These phenomena were interpreted by
    ancient peoples as divine or supernatural events, deeply ingraining
    them into their collective psyches.

2.  **Artistic Representation**: The awe-inspiring visuals led to their
    representation in rock and cave art, with similar shapes like
    spirals, waves, and humanoid figures with halo-like features
    appearing worldwide.

3.  **Oral Tradition**: Stories and myths about these lights were passed
    down through generations, further cementing their importance and
    leading to a shared cultural memory.

#### Evidence:

1.  **Artistic Similarities**: The common imagery in rock art worldwide,
    such as spirals, circles, and 'stick figures,' could be interpreted
    as artistic renditions of these phenomena.

2.  **Geological Records**: Sediment and ice core samples could show
    elevated levels of isotopes that are indicative of high solar
    activity during that period.

3.  **Mythological Correlation**: A study of ancient myths and legends
    across cultures could reveal common themes that align with the
    phenomena witnessed.

By connecting the dots between solar activity, Earth's magnetosphere,
and ancient art, the "Global Aurora Theory" could offer a unified
explanation for the similarities in ancient rock art worldwide. What do
you think?
