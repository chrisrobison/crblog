We’ve all been there. You’re on your computer, online taking care of
business. You’re just wrapping up the final part of a 6-part online job
application form and you click submit. The page just spins and after a
few seconds, you get the dreaded “Network not available” screen and all
your work is now gone. Sure, browser s have gotten better at recovering
from these types of scenarios but we need to be able to write software
that will work, offline or online, if we expect users to rely on our
web-based applications.

Until recently, there was little you could do to address the loss of
connectivity as there was no client-side control mechanism for offline
asset caching nor any way to hook into and hijack network requests. But
now there are Service Workers. They’re perfect for asset caching, which
can not only dramatically speed up your web apps, but can also make them
available offline. But don’t confuse `Service Workers` with
`Web Workers`; They are very similar but have one key diff erence:
`Service Workers` are persistent while `Web Workers` are not. That means
anything done in a Service Worker will continue to execute, even af ter
the page has unloaded while anything done within a Web Worker is removed
when the page is closed.

tl;dr: A service worker functions like a proxy server, allowing you to
modify requests and responses replacing them with items from its own
cache. In this post, I’ll walk through setting up a service worker for
caching assets and explore using a couple of different caching
strategies.

Setup: Registering a Service Worker
-----------------------------------

Before we dive into caching, we’ll need to register a service worker.
Service Workers must be served over HTTPS as they are restricted to
secure domains.

> If you don’t have a secure domain you can use, `localhost` is usually
> considered a secure origin by most browsers for local development.

Save the following code in a file called `sw.js`.

    self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
      // Your install logic here
    });

    self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
      // Your fetch logic here
    });

This next part is our entry point into using service workers. Include
this code in your main JavaScript file (app.js) to register the service
worker:

    const registerServiceWorker = async () => {
      if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
        try {
          const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register("/sw.js", {
            scope: "/",
          });
          if (registration.installing) {
            console.log("Service worker installing");
          } else if (registration.waiting) {
            console.log("Service worker installed");
          } else if (registration.active) {
            console.log("Service worker active");
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(`Registration failed with ${error}`);
        }
      }
    };

    // …

    registerServiceWorker();

1.  The if-block performs a feature detection test to make sure service
    workers are supported before trying to register one.
2.  Then ServiceWorkerContainer.register() function is called to
    register the service worker for this site. The service worker code
    is in a JavaScript file residing inside our app

Remember, that this code is run as a service worker, which runs in a
worker context, and therefore has no DOM access.

Fill your cache: install & activate:
------------------------------------

After the service worker is registered, the browser will attempt to
`install` and then `activate` the service worker for your app.

The `install` event is fired when an service worker installation is
successfully completed. The `install` event is where you pre-fetch the
assets you need to run your app offline and store them for later use. We
use the Service Worker’s storage API, aptly named `cache`, which is
basically a non-blocking persistent version of localStorage where we
store our pre-fetched assets keyed by their request URL. The contents of
the cache are kept until they are cleared or overwritten.

Here’s how a service worker handles the install event:

    const addResourcesToCache = async (resources) => {
      const cache = await caches.open("v1");
      await cache.addAll(resources);
    };

    self.addEventListener("install", (event) => {
      event.waitUntil(
        addResourcesToCache([
          "/",
          "/index.html",
          "/style.css",
          "/app.js",
          "/data.json",
          "/img/logo.jpg",
          "/img/image1.jpg",
          "/img/image2.jpg"
        ]),
      );
    });

1.  First we add an `install` event listener to the service worker
    (hence self), and then chain a ExtendableEvent.waitUntil() method
    onto the event. This creates a promise that ensures that the service
    worker will not install until the code inside waitUntil() has
    completed.
2.  Inside addResourcesToCache() we use the caches.open() method to
    create a new cache called v1, which will be version 1 of our site
    resources cache. Then we call a function addAll() on the created
    cache with an array of URLs to cache.
3.  If the promise is rejected, the installation fails, and the worker
    won’t do anything. This is OK, as you can fix your code and then try
    again the next time registration occurs.
4.  After a successful installation, the service worker activates.

Custom responses to requests
----------------------------

With our assets now cached, we need to instruct our service workers on
how to serve our cached content. This is done within the fetch event.

1.  A fetch event fires every time any resource controlled by a service
    worker is requested, which includes the documents inside the
    specified scope, and any resources referenced in those documents
    (for example if index.html makes a cross-origin request to embed an
    image, that still goes through its service worker.)
2.  Add an event listener for the `fetch` event to the service worker,
    then call the `respondWith()` method on the event to hijack the HTTP
    requests and respond with our cached content.

<!-- -->

    self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
      event.respondWith(caches.match(event.request));
    });

`caches.match(event.request)` allows us to match each resource requested
from the network with the equivalent resource available in the cache, if
there is a matching one available. The matching is done via URL and
various headers, just like with normal HTTP requests.

Failed Requests
---------------

`caches.match(event.request)` works great when it matches something in
the service worker cache, but what about when there isn’t? As our code
currently stands, there is no failure handling so our promise would end
up resolving with `undefined` and we wouldn’t get anything returned.

Let’s add some code that first tries the cache and falls back to a
regular network request:

    const cacheFirst = async (request) => {
      const responseFromCache = await caches.match(request);
      if (responseFromCache) {
        return responseFromCache;
      }
      return fetch(request);
    };

    self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
      event.respondWith(cacheFirst(event.request));
    });

If the resources aren’t in the cache, they are requested from the
network. This is usually referred to as the “cache-then-network”
strategy. But we can do better.

By adding a few extra lines of code, we can not only request the
un-cached resources from the network but we can also store them in our
cache for later. This allows your app to consistently work offline, even
when new resources are requested:

    const putInCache = async (request, response) => {
      const cache = await caches.open("v1");
      await cache.put(request, response);
    };

    const cacheFirst = async (request) => {
      const responseFromCache = await caches.match(request);
      if (responseFromCache) {
        return responseFromCache;
      }
      const responseFromNetwork = await fetch(request);
      putInCache(request, responseFromNetwork.clone());
      return responseFromNetwork;
    };

    self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
      event.respondWith(cacheFirst(event.request));
    });

The only trouble we have now is that if the request doesn’t match
anything in the cache, and the network is not available, our request
will still fail. Let’s provide a default fallback so that whatever
happens, the user will at least get something:

    const putInCache = async (request, response) => {
      const cache = await caches.open("v1");
      await cache.put(request, response);
    };

    const cacheFirst = async ({ request, fallbackUrl }) => {
      // First try to get the resource from the cache
      const responseFromCache = await caches.match(request);
      if (responseFromCache) {
        return responseFromCache;
      }

      // Next try to get the resource from the network
      try {
        const responseFromNetwork = await fetch(request);
        
        // response cloned because responses can only be read once
        putInCache(request, responseFromNetwork.clone());   
        return responseFromNetwork;
      } catch (error) {
        const fallbackResponse = await caches.match(fallbackUrl);
        if (fallbackResponse) {
          return fallbackResponse;
        }
        // when even the fallback response is not available,
        // there is nothing we can do, but we must always
        // return a Response object. Let's return a nice message
        return new Response("External resource unavailable", {
          status: 408,
          headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
        });
      }
    };

    self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
      event.respondWith(
        cacheFirst({
          request: event.request,
          fallbackUrl: "/img/image1.jpg",
        }),
      );
    });

Service worker updates
----------------------

If there is an updated version of a previously installed service worker,
the newer version will be available on page refresh/reload. It is
installed in the background but will not be activated yet. It is only
activated when there are no longer any pages loaded that are still using
the old service worker. As soon as nothing is using the old service
worker, the new service worker will be activated.

You will need to update your `install` event listener in the new service
worker with a new version number:

    const addResourcesToCache = async (resources) => {
      const cache = await caches.open("v2");
      await cache.addAll(resources);
    };

    self.addEventListener("install", (event) => {
      event.waitUntil(
        addResourcesToCache([
          "/",
          "/index.html",
          "/style.css",
          "/app.js",
          "/image-list.js",

          // …

          // include other new resources for the new version…
        ]),
      );
    });

Removing stale content
----------------------

When a service worker is updated to a new version, a new cache is
created in the `install` event handler. If there are open pages that are
using the previous version of the worker, both caches must be kept. You
can use the `activate` event to remove data from the previous caches.

Promises passed into `waitUntil()` will block other events until
completion, so the clean-up operation is guaranteed to have completed by
the time the first fetch event on the new service worker fires.

    const deleteCache = async (key) => {
      await caches.delete(key);
    };

    const deleteOldCaches = async () => {
      const cacheKeepList = ["v2"];
      const keyList = await caches.keys();
      const cachesToDelete = keyList.filter((key) => !cacheKeepList.includes(key));
      await Promise.all(cachesToDelete.map(deleteCache));
    };

    self.addEventListener("activate", (event) => {
      event.waitUntil(deleteOldCaches());
    });
