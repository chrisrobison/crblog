### About

I've been using AlterVista for thesaurus lookups for years and up until
now, I had been content with my boring lists of returned words. It was
better than -any- of the mainstream alternatives which bombard you with
ads and brings your computer to its knees with its web pages heavy with
external libraries and trackers. But I recently wanted a way to
visualize my lookups and be able to tunnel from word to word while still
retaining my previous lookups. I've used D3.js in the past and so I
quickly wrote a force directed graph for my thesaurus using D3.js. But
still I was not satisfied. It still felt heavy. I know it's all probably
in my head because I -know- there's a bunch of external code being
loaded; but there were long pauses while before rendereing which I
chalked up to all the bells and whistles D3.js provides. So I wrote my
own.

I wrote a bare-bones JavaScript directed graph thesaurus library that is
pretty unique in that it doesn't use canvas OR SVG (yet!), it only uses
DOM elements, JavaScript and CSS. I know, the node layout algorithm
needs a little attention but the basics are there and work. The
connecting lines are simply DIV tags with a 4px height that I calculate
the length and rotation using some basic trigonometry and apply using
CSS. The only trick was changing the transform-origin to \[0, 0\]
instead of the default of center.

So try it out! Enter in a few words, drag a few bubbles around and be
amazed at the clever use of CSS and math to get something you would
normally need to do with canvas.
