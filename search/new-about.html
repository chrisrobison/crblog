Introduction
[]
Hello, my name is Christopher Robison. I am a Software Engineer and
Technology Wizard currently living in San Francisco, California. I am
writing this About page to give a brief introduction to me, Christopher
Robison, detailing who I am, where I come from and where I'm going. So
let's get started, shall we?
The Early Years
Born in the analog world of the early 1970's, I started life in Southern
California, born 2 weeks late and with a head already full of hair. My
mother was only 19 and quite small for someone having a 10lbs baby. I
was such a big baby and she such a small lady that we ended up in the
local newspaper. My poor mother even received visits from strangers who
wanted to "see the little lady who had the big baby". I've been told I
was an exceptionally bright child with an insatiable curiosity and a
knack for taking things apart such as disassembling my crib while in it
in order to escape my captivity. I did the same thing with my playpen
and highchair. My poor parents had to get all new baby furniture when my
sister was born because I had disassembled or otherwise broken all
ofmine. In fact, I believe my sister's baby crib is still being passed
around the family.
My father was a police officer in Downey, CA and my mom worked as a
secretary at a High School in Norwalk. My maternal grandfather was
Superintendent of the LA School District, at the time the second largest
school district in the US. My other grandfather worked for NASA as an
engineer. It was a pretty ideallic upbringing and I feel blessed to have
been born at that time: exposed to the analog world but quickly shown
the wonders of the digital realm. My penchant for taking things apart to
see how they worked only grew stronger the older I got. I took apart my
bicycle, my parents VCR, I improved my grandpa's electric train set. I
was usually able to put everything back together and get things working
again, but not always.
I spent the first 10 years of my life growing up in Southern California.
We moved quite a few times but we mostly stayed in the vicinity of
Norwalk, which is where my maternal Grandparents lived. They would help
out with watching me (and later my sister, Tina, as well) whenever my
parents had to work or go to a kid-free event. Some of my best memories
are from being at my grandparents house; it was really a second home for
us.
Move to Paradise
Being a police officer in Downey in the 1970's was not the safest of
professions and my Dad wanted something better. When his police academy
buddie told him about a new police department being formed in a newly
incorporated city in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, he
jumped at the chance. My parents fell in love with Paradise; it was a
long ways from the gangs, traffic, smog and strip malls of LA county and
it was just what they were looking for. I was 10 at the time, just going
into 5th grade. My sister was 7 and going into 2nd grade. I'd like to
say everything was sunshine and rainbows but it was a bit of culture
shock for me. I'm not sure how the rest of the family feels about it now
but looking back, it was a huge change for a 10 year old boy from the
city to be thrust into what was essentially "the woods". I went from a
place with millions of people squeezed into a small area to a town of
20,000 people who all seemed to know each other or were related.
I started the 5th grade not knowing what to expect so I put on my OP
tshirt and Vans slip-ons and went to school. Upon arrival I felt as
though I had been transported back 10 years. Everyone looked like they
came straight out of a home movie from 1970. Cowboy boots, flanel shirts
with mother-of-pearl snap buttons. One kid even wore a bolo tie. Then
they started poking fun at how -I- was dressed! I couldn't believe it. I
came to discover that, at that time, fashion and trends in Paradise were
a good 3-5 years behind LA. It sounds stupid now but at the time it was
a big deal for me. I was already very self-conscious and did not want to
stand out but I refused to wear cowboy boots and mother-of-pearl snaps
simply on principle.
So I started out an outsider, albiet a nicely dressed one. I got through
the rest of elementary and junior high without much incident but high
school is another story.
The Later Years
I was married for 20 years but got divorced back in 2015; we are still
good friends and talk often. with nearly two decades of experience in
the tech industry. Throughout my career, I've developed a knack for
leading cross-functional teams, innovating data-driven solutions, and
building scalable full-stack applications for enterprises and startups
alike. Over the years I've been able apply my tech skills to a variety
of industries such as online finance, biotech, internet, and
transportation, which has allowed me to see beyond the technology and
into the bigger picture.
Background
I've earned my stripes in software engineering at leading companies such
as Conversant Media, where I first lead their Rich Media group for 3
years and then headed up their Mobile Ad division for seven years.
There, I honed my skills in cloud infrastructure, AWS, GCP, and other
modern technologies that enable high-performance computing and data
analysis. My team and I consistently pushed the boundaries of what's
possible in customer engagement and set new industry benchmarks along
the way, including contributing to the IAB's MRAID 2.0 standard. I
cloned a cat while at Genetic Savings & Clone while building their
business process automation application. I built a life-sized
"box-seat-simulator" for the San Diego Padres new stadium so potential
ticket buyers could see the view they would have from their seats. I
have a passion for creating things.

But I'm not just about the code; I'm also passionate about people.
Leadership and fostering a positive culture are priorities for me. I
believe that a well-motivated, excellently trained team is the backbone
of any successful project. And when that team is working on something as
meaningful as healthcare or as transformative as real-time bidding in
advertising, the sky's the limit.
Current Status
Currently based in San Francisco and working with D Harris Tours, a
transportation company with a fleet of over 14 buses and over $1.5
million yearly revenue (and growing!). I am, however, always looking for
exciting new opportunities that will challenge me technically and offer
leadership roles. In addition to my technical pursuits, I'm a strong
advocate for open dialogue and intellectual curiosity. Whether it's
attending live punk rock shows or hitting the karaoke bars, I believe
life should be as enriching outside of work as it is within the
professional sphere.

Goals
I am now looking for challenging opportunities where my extensive
experience, technical acumen and management capabilities can be used to
bring innovative projects to the world and build and lead dynamic teams.
Then maybe I'll take a nap.
