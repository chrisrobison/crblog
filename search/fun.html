This is a small collection of some of the silly, fun projects I've done
in the past that are the result of recreational programming, trying out
various ideas or demonstrating something new. None of these are meant to
be complete; They are "works-in-progress" that I'll touch from time to
time and improve on. Some are more complete than others, some things may
not even run. They are just for fun. So enjoy!
