  Fun is one of the most important - and underrated - ingredients in any
  successful venture. If you're not having fun, then it's probably time
  to call it quits and try something else. -- Sir Richard Branson

This is a small collection of some of the silly, fun projects I've done
in the past that are the result of recreational programming, trying out
various ideas or demonstrating something new. None of these are meant to
be complete; They are "works-in-progress" that I'll touch from time to
time and improve on. Some are more complete than others, some things may
not even run. They are just for fun. So enjoy!
