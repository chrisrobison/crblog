The definition of what a "Doodle" is varies depending on who you ask. I
would define a doodle as: “*Art or drawing made while a person is bored
or thinking of something else.*” While these aren't exactly drawings,
these are my doodles I've made while thinking or trying out some new
technology or just seeing if something *could* be done.

Never underestimate the importance of having fun while getting the job
done. [Google](https://google.com) has famously [changed their
logo](https://www.google.com/doodles/about) with doodles to celebrate
holidays and events and I have always admired their creative animations.
But what I admire most about Google's Doodles is that it's a company
having fun and that's something you don't see very often.

So enjoy these distractions. They serve no purpose other than to be fun
to look at and to distract your mind.
