        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/user2-160x160.jpg" style="float:right;filter:grayscale(1) brightness(1) ;">
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Christopher Robison.  I am a Software Engineer and Technology Wizard currently living in San Francisco, California. I am writing this <em>About</em> page to give a brief introduction to me, Christopher Robison, detailing who I am, where I come from and where I'm going. So let's get started, shall we?</p>
        <h3>The Early Years</h3>
        <p>
          Born in the analog world of the early 1970's, I started life in Southern California, born 2 weeks late and with a head already full of hair. My mother was only 19 and quite small for someone having a 10lbs baby. I was such a big baby and she such a small lady that we ended up in the local newspaper. My poor mother even received visits from strangers who wanted to "see the little lady who had the big baby". I've been told I was an exceptionally bright child with an insatiable curiosity and a knack for taking things apart such as disassembling my crib while in it in order to escape my captivity. I did the same thing with my playpen and highchair. My poor parents had to get all new baby furniture when my sister was born because I had disassembled or otherwise broken all ofmine. In fact, I believe my sister's baby crib is still being passed around the family.</p>
        <p>My father was a police officer in Downey, CA and my mom worked as a secretary at a High School in Norwalk. My maternal grandfather was Superintendent of the LA School District, at the time the second largest school district in the US. My other grandfather worked for NASA as an engineer. It was a pretty ideallic upbringing and I feel blessed to have been born at that time: exposed to the analog world but quickly shown the wonders of the digital realm. My penchant for taking things apart to see how they worked only grew stronger the older I got. I took apart my bicycle, my parents VCR, I improved my grandpa's electric train set. I was usually able to put everything back together and get things working again, but not always.
        </p>
        <h3>The Later Years</h3>
        <p>, see where I was married for 20 years but got divorced back in 2015; we are still good friends and talk often.    with nearly two decades of experience in the tech industry. Throughout my career, I've developed a knack for leading cross-functional teams, innovating data-driven solutions, and building scalable full-stack applications for enterprises and startups alike. Over the years I've been able apply my tech skills to a variety of industries such as online finance, biotech, internet, and transportation, which has allowed me to see beyond the technology and into the bigger picture.  
        </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
     I've earned my stripes in software engineering at leading companies such as Conversant Media, where I first lead their Rich Media group for 3 years and then headed up their Mobile Ad division for seven years. There, I honed my skills in cloud infrastructure, AWS, GCP, and other modern technologies that enable high-performance computing and data analysis. My team and I consistently pushed the boundaries of what's possible in customer engagement and set new industry benchmarks along the way, including contributing to the IAB's MRAID 2.0 standard.  I cloned a cat while at Genetic Savings &amp; Clone while building their business process automation application. I built a life-sized "box-seat-simulator" for the San Diego Padres new stadium so potential ticket buyers could see the view they would have from their seats. I have a passion for creating things.
            </p>
              <img src="pics/?1" class='banner-pic'><br>
      <p>
          But I'm not just about the code; I'm also passionate about people. Leadership and fostering a positive culture are priorities for me. I believe that a well-motivated, excellently trained team is the backbone of any successful project. And when that team is working on something as meaningful as healthcare or as transformative as real-time bidding in advertising, the sky's the limit.
        </p>
        <h3>Current Status</h3>
        <p>
          Currently based in San Francisco and working with D Harris Tours, a transportation company with a fleet of over 14 buses and over $1.5 million yearly revenue (and growing!).  I am, however, always looking for exciting new opportunities that will challenge me technically and offer leadership roles. In addition to my technical pursuits, I'm a strong advocate for open dialogue and intellectual curiosity. Whether it's attending live punk rock shows or hitting the karaoke bars, I believe life should be as enriching outside of work as it is within the professional sphere. 
        </p>
      <img src="pics/?3" class='banner-pic'><br>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
          I am now looking for challenging opportunities where my extensive experience, technical acumen and management capabilities can be used to bring innovative projects to the world and build and lead dynamic teams. Then maybe I'll take a nap.</p>
