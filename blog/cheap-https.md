# Let's Encrypt: Switching Your Website to HTTPS on a Shoestring Budget

In the ever-evolving landscape of the internet, security is not just a luxury; it's a necessity. For website owners, one of the fundamental steps to secure your site and gain your visitors' trust is by switching from HTTP to HTTPS. But what if you're on a tight budget? That's where Let's Encrypt comes into play.

## What is Let's Encrypt?

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org){target="_blank"} is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority (CA) launched in April 2016. It's a project of the [Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)](https://www.abetterinternet.org/){target="_blank"}, backed by major companies like [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org/){target="_blank"}, [Cisco](https://cisco.com/){target="_blank"}, [Akamai](https://akamai.com){target="_blank"}, [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/){target="_blank"}, and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/){target="_blank"}. The primary goal of Let's Encrypt is to make encrypted connections on the web ubiquitous and easy to set up.

### The Backers and Goals

The backing by industry giants provides Let's Encrypt with the necessary resources and credibility. These companies have a shared interest in making the web more secure and privacy-respecting. The goal of Let's Encrypt is simple yet ambitious: to encrypt the entire web, making HTTPS the default web protocol.

## Why HTTPS?

Switching to HTTPS not only secures the data between your website and its users but also boosts your SEO rankings, as search engines like Google favor secure sites. It also gives your visitors confidence, knowing their data is protected.

## Upgrading to HTTPS with Certbot

Certbot is a free, open-source software tool for automatically using Letâ€™s Encrypt certificates on manually-administered websites to enable HTTPS. It's developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and is designed to simplify the process of setting up and maintaining an HTTPS server. 

Certbot can automatically upgrade/update most server configurations and supports a variety of web servers such as Apache and nginx. Site verification can be handled automatically by certbot or you can verify manually using DNS or by placing a file in your servers document tree. 

Now that we've got the what, who, and why out of the way, let's see how it works by setting up HTTPS for a basic Apache installation.

### Step-by-Step Guide

Here's a basic guide to get you started with Certbot. Note that you'll need shell access to your web server and appropriate permissions to execute commands.

1. **Install Certbot**: The first step is to install Certbot. The installation method varies depending on your server's operating system but certbot is included in most package managers. For a Linux server running Debian, you would use:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install certbot
   ```

2. **Choose Your Web Server and Operating System**: Go to the [Certbot website](https://certbot.eff.org/) and select your web server and operating system for tailored instructions.

3. **Get and Install Your Certificates**: To setup and configure Apache, run Certbot with the following command, replacing `your_domain` with your actual domain name:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot --apache -d your_domain.com -d www.your_domain.com
   ```

   This command will run Certbot with the `--apache` plugin, using `-d` to specify the domains. Change the plugin[s] being used based on your server and configuration. You can get a list of available plugins by running:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot plugins
   ```

4. **Test Automatic Renewal**: Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. Test the automatic renewal process with:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

5. **Set Up Auto-Renewal**: You can set up a cron job or a systemd timer for automatic renewal.

6. **Verify HTTPS**: Once installed, visit your website with `https://` to ensure everything is working correctly.

### Final Thoughts

Switching to HTTPS is no longer a matter of choice but a necessity in the modern web. With tools like Let's Encrypt and Certbot, this transition becomes accessible to everyone, regardless of budget. It's a small step for a single website but a giant leap towards a more secure and trustworthy internet.

Remember, the web is a shared resource, and we all have a part in keeping it safe and accessible. Happy encrypting!
