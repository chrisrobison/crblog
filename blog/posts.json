For me, serif fonts convey a air of professionalism but at the same time I find them a litte busy to the eye. They are supposed to be easier to read (have I been conditioned by newspapers?) but most online publications seem to use sanserif fonts. What's the deal? As digital experiences continue to evolve, the choice of fonts in web and mobile design plays a pivotal role in shaping user engagement and readability. The concept of optical sizing, a design practice where typefaces are tailored for different display sizes, is especially crucial in this context. Let's delve into why font choice matters and how you can implement it effectively in your designs."

Until recently, there was little you could do to address the loss of connectivity as there was no client-side control mechanism for offline asset caching or hooking into network requests. But now there are Service Workers. They're perfect for asset caching, which can not only dramatically speed up your web apps, but can also make them available offline. Don't confuse <code>Service Workers</code> with <code>Web Workers</code>; They are very similar but the main difference between the two is that <code>Service Workers</code> are persistent while <code>Web Workers</code> are not.
