One of the most significant leaps in JavaScript's journey has been the introduction and widespread adoption of client-side modules. Modules have revolutionized how developers structure their code, making it more manageable, reusable, and efficient. Let's delve into the history, uses, and benefits of client-side JavaScript modules, complete with some code examples."

The page just spins and after a few seconds, you get the dreaded <q>Network not available</q> screen and all your work is now gone. Sure, browsers have gotten better at recovering from these types of scenarios but we need to be able to write software that will work, offline or online, if we expect users to rely on our web application. Until recently, there was little you could do to address the loss of connectivity as there was no client-side control mechanism for offline asset caching or hooking into network requests. But now there are Service Workers. They're perfect for asset caching, which can not only dramatically speed up your web apps, but can also make them available offline. Don't confuse <code>Service Workers</code> with <code>Web Workers</code>; They are very similar but the main difference between the two is that <code>Service Workers</code> are persistent while <code>Web Workers</code> are not. In this post, I'll walk through setting up a service worker for caching assets and explore a couple of different caching strategies."
