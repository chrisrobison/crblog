          <p>In the intricate tapestry of time, the calendar stands as one of
humanity’s most vital creations. It defines and regulates our lives in
such a fundamental way that we don’t give a second thought as to how it
came to be. Well, I’m here to tell that tale. As we embark on this
whimsical journey through its history, we’ll uncover the fascinating
reasons behind the seemingly haphazard arrangement of months and why the
celebrations of the New Year in various cultures happens in February.
Let’s set the stage for a captivating exploration into the fascinating
world of calendars.</p>
<p><strong>The Ancient Roots of the Calendar:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of a calendar is to reckon time in advance, to show how
many days have to elapse until a certain event takes place in the
future, such as the harvest or the release of Grand Theft Auto 6. The
earliest calendars, naturally, were crude and tended to be based upon
the seasons or the lunar cycle. As it is today, so it was in our ancient
past: we need to eat and growing food requires knowing when to plant and
when to harvest. The early lunar-based calendars tracked the moon’s
phases, with months roughly corresponding to the moon’s 29.5-day cycle.
These lunar calendars laid the foundation for what would become the
Gregorian calendar we use today. But the lunar cycle does not help when
it comes to discerning when to plant your crops; the tilt of the earth
combined with its position circling the sun is responsible for that. So
from the start we had a conflict of competing methods of tracking the
date. The moon cycle is much easier to observe and but it does not sync
up with the solar year and, over time, the date when you should be
planting your crops will drift to the point where you are no longer
planting on the correct day.</p>
<p><strong>Marching into the Past:</strong></p>
<p>The calendar of the Assyrians, for example, was based upon the phases
of the moon. They knew that a lunation (the time from one full moon to
the next) was 29 1/2 days long, so their lunar year had a duration of
354 days. This fell short of the solar year by about 11 days. (The exact
time for the solar year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes,
and 46 seconds.) After 3 years, such a lunar calendar would be off by a
whole month, so the Assyrians added an extra month from time to time to
keep their calendar in synchronization with the seasons.</p>
<p>The best approximation that was possible in antiquity was a 19-year
period, with 7 of these 19 years having 13 months (leap months). This
scheme was adopted as the basis for the lunar calendar used by the
Hebrews. The Arabs also used this calendar until Mohammed forbade
shifting from 12 months to 13 months; this causes the Muslim holy month
of Ramadan to move backwards through the seasons, completing a cycle
every 32 1/2 years.</p>
<p>When Rome emerged as a world power, the difficulties of making a
calendar were well known, but the Romans complicated their lives because
of their superstition that even numbers were unlucky. Hence their months
were 29 or 31 days long, with the exception of February, which had 28
days. Every second year, the Roman calendar included an extra month
called Mercedonius of 22 or 23 days to keep up with the solar year.</p>
<p><strong>The Julian Calendar:</strong></p>
<p>Even this algorithm was very poor, so that in 45 BCE, Caesar, advised
by the astronomer Sosigenes, ordered a sweeping reform. By imperial
decree, the year 46 BCE was made 445 days long to bring the calendar
back in step with the seasons. The new calendar, similar to the one we
now use was called the Julian calendar (named after Julius Caesar).</p>
<p>Months in the Julian calendar were 30 or 31 days in length and every
fourth year was made a leap year (having 366 days) by adding a day to
the end of the year. This leap year rule was not consistantly applied
until 8 CE. The year-ending month of February, never a popular month,
was presently shortened so that Julius Caesar and Emperor Augustus could
each have long months named after them.</p>
<p>Caesar also decreed that the year would start with the first of
January, which since 153 BCE was the day that Roman consuls took office,
and not the vernal equinox in late March. Not everyone accepted that
part of his reform, as we shall see.</p>
<p><strong>The Gregorian Calendar Reform:</strong></p>
<p>Caesar’s year was 11 1/2 minutes short of the calculations
recommended by Sosigenes and eventually the date of the vernal equinox
began to drift. Roger Bacon became alarmed and sent a note to Pope
Clement IV, who apparently was not impressed. Pope Sixtus IV later
became convinced that another reform was needed and called the German
astronomer, Regiomontanus, to Rome to advise him. Unfortunately,
Regiomontanus died of the plague shortly thereafter and the plans died
as well.</p>
<p>In 1545, the Council of Trent authorized Pope Gregory XIII to reform
the calendar once more. Most of the mathematical work was done by Father
Christopher Clavius, S.J. The immediate correction that was adopted was
that Thursday, October 4, 1582 was to be the last day of the Julian
calendar. The next day was Friday, with the date of October 15. For long
range accuracy, a formula suggested by the Vatican librarian Aloysius
Giglio was adopted. It said that every fourth year is a leap year except
for century years that are not divisible by 400. Thus 1700, 1800 and
1900 would not be leap years, but 2000 would be a leap year since 2000
is divisible by 400. This rule eliminates 3 leap years every 4
centuries, making the calendar sufficiently correct for most ordinary
purposes. This calendar is known as the Gregorian calendar and is the
one that we now use today.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in 1582, all the Protestant princes
ignored the papal decree and so many countries continued to use the
Julian calendar until either 1698 or 1752. Britain and its American
colonies went from Wednesday, September 2, 1752 to Thursday, September
14. Prior to the changeover, the British used March 25 as the start of
the new year.</p>
<p>In Russia, it needed the revolution to introduce the Gregorian
calendar in 1918. Turkey didn’t adopt it until 1927.</p>
<p><strong>The Numbering of the Year:</strong></p>
<p>The numbering of the year is generally done according to an “era”,
such as the year of a ruler’s reign.</p>
<p>In about 525, a monk named Dionysius Exiguus suggested that the
calculated year of Jesus’ birth be designated as year 1 in the Julian
calendar. This suggestion was adopted over the next 500 years and
subsequently followed in the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>For the benefit of those who seek religious significance to the
calendar millenium, note that year 1 is too late by at least 4 years.
Herod the Great, named in the Christian Bible as having all children in
Bethlehem put to death in an attempt to kill the infant Jesus, died in 4
BCE.</p>
<p>Nothing particularly significant of an historic or religious nature
happened in Gregorian year 1; however it has become a worldwide standard
as the “common era.” In modern times, the terms “CE” (common era) and
“BCE” (before common era) are preferred over the earlier (and, as we
have seen, less accurate) “AD” (anno Domini, “the year of the Lord”) and
“BC” (before Christ).</p>
<p>The Hebrew lunar calendar begins at 3760 BCE, the year of creation in
Jewish tradition. The Muslim lunar calendar begins on July 16, 622, when
Mohammed fled from Mecca to Medina.</p>
<p>The Japanese, Taiwanese, and North Koreans use the Gregorian
calendar, but number the year by political era. In Japan, an era begins
when an emperor succeeds to the throne; year 1 of the Heisei era was
1989 when Emperor Akihito ascended to the throne (the first few days of
1989 was year 64 of the Shouwa era). In Taiwan, year 1 is the first full
year after the founding of the Republic of China in 1911. In North
Korea, year 1 is the year of the Juche (self-reliance) ideal,
corresponding to the birth year of founder Kim Il-Sung (1912). Thus,
year 2020 is Reiwa 2 (Japan), 109th year of the Republic (Taiwan), and
Juche 109 (North Korea).</p>
<p><strong>Further Modifications to the Gregorian Calendar:</strong></p>
<p>Despite the great accuracy of the Gregorian calendar, it still falls
behind very slightly every few years. The most serious problem is that
the earth’s rotation is slowing gradually. If you are very concerned
about this problem, you can tune in short wave radio station WWV or the
Global Positioning System, which broadcasts official time signals for
use in the United States. About once every 3 years, they declare a leap
second at which time you should be careful to adjust your system clock.
If you have trouble picking up their signals, you can simply purchase an
atomic clock.</p>
<p>There is still the problem that the Gregorian calendar represents a
year of 365.2425 days and the actual time taken for the earth to rotate
around the Sun is 365.2421991 days. That means that the Gregorian
calendar is actually 26 seconds slow each year, resulting in the
calendar being one day behind every 3,300 or so years (a Y3.3K
problem).</p>
<p>Consequently, the Gregorian calendar has been modified with a further
rule, which is that years evenly divisible by 4000 are not leap years.
Thus, the year 4000 will not be a leap year. Or, at least we assume
that’s what will happen assuming that the calendar remains unchanged for
the next 2000 years.</p>
<p>The modified Gregorian calendar represents a year of 365.24225 days.
Thus, the modified Gregorian calendar is actually 4 seconds slow each
year, resulting in the calendar being one day slow every 20,000 or so
years. So there will be a Y20K problem.</p>
<p>There is some dispute whether the modified Gregorian calendar was
officially adopted, or if it’s just a proposal. Other options (see
below) exist; fortunately no decision needs to be made for several
centuries yet.</p>
<p><strong>Eastern Orthodox Modification of the Gregorian
Calendar:</strong></p>
<p>The Eastern Orthodox church in 1923 established its own rules to
correct the Julian calendar. In their calendar, century years modulo 900
must result in value of 200 or 600 to be considered a leap year. Both
the Orthodox and Gregorian calendar agree that the years 2000 and 2400
will be leap years, and the years 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600,
2700 are not. However, the year 2800 will be a leap year in the
Gregorian calendar but not in the Orthodox calendar; similarly, the year
2900 will be a leap year in the Orthodox calendar but not in the
Gregorian calendar. Both calendars will agree that 3000 and 3100 are
leap years, but will disagree again in 3200 and 3300.</p>
<p>The Orthodox calendar represents a year of 365.24222222… days. Thus,
the Orthodox calendar is actually 2 seconds slow each year, resulting in
the calendar being one day slow every 40,000 or so years. The Eastern
Orthodox church has not yet made any statements on how the Y40K bug will
be fixed.</p>
<p><strong>The Quirky February New Year Celebrations:</strong></p>
<p>Now, let’s delve into the world of New Year celebrations in February.
Many cultures, such the Chinese, Vietnamese, and Tibetan, celebrate
their New Year based on lunar or lunisolar calendars. This results in
New Year festivities that usually fall between January 21st and February
20th in our Gregorian calendar. These celebrations embrace the arrival
of spring and the promise of new beginnings, aligning with the lunar
cycles.</p>
<p><strong>Meanings of Day Names:</strong></p>
<p>The names of days of the week from a combination of Roman and
Germanic names for celestial bodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunday: Latin “dies solis” =&gt; “Sun’s day”</li>
<li>Monday: Latin “dies lunae” =&gt; “Moon’s day”</li>
<li>Tuesday: Germanic “Tiw’s day” =&gt; “Mars’ day”</li>
<li>Wednesday: Germanic “Woden’s day” =&gt; “Mercury’s day”</li>
<li>Thursday: Germanic “Thor’s day” =&gt; “Jupiter’s day”</li>
<li>Friday: Germanic “Frigg’s day” =&gt; “Venus’ day”</li>
<li>Saturday: Latin “dies Saturni” =&gt; “Saturn’s day”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Meanings of Month Names:</strong></p>
<p>The names of the months are from the Roman calendar:</p>
<ul>
<li>January: Janus, protector of doorways</li>
<li>February: Februalia, a time for sacrifice to atone for sins</li>
<li>March: Mars, god of war</li>
<li>April: Latin “aperire” =&gt; “to open” buds</li>
<li>May: Maia, goddess of plant growth</li>
<li>June: Latin “juvenis” =&gt; “youth”</li>
<li>July: Julius Caesar</li>
<li>August: Augustus Caesar</li>
<li>September: Latin “septem” =&gt; “seven”</li>
<li>October: Latin “octo” =&gt; “eight”</li>
<li>November: Latin “novem” =&gt; “nine”</li>
<li>December: Latin “decem” =&gt; “ten”</li>
</ul>
<p>As you’ll notice, the last four months are numbered 7 to 10, which is
an artifact of the time when the new year started in March.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>So that’s all I know about the history of calendars. Actually, I have
some neat formulas for calculating the day of the week or the days
between two dates but I’ll save those for another time. Thanks for
reading!</p>
