          <p>San Francisco has earned a reputation as a world-class haunted city.
With it’s beginnings as a gold rush town through today’s technology
boom, The City’s tumultuous past has lured many tortured souls to
remain. This is my personal list of haunted or spooky places in San
Francisco that you don’t usually see in other lists. This list is by no
means exhaustive, just some places and stories I have found to be spooky
and interesting.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><a
href="https://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/historyculture/sutro-baths.htm">Sutro
Baths</a></strong>:</p>
<p>The tunnel/cave carved into the rockface at the former location of
the Sutro Baths at Lands End is rumored to have any number of ghosts,
demons or sea creatures that leave large claw marks scratched into the
rock. There is also an urban legend that if you take a lit candle to the
northern end of the tunnel, an unseen force will take the candle and
launch it into the surf below.</p>
<address>
<p>Address: 1004 Point Lobos Ave</p>
</address></li>
<li><p><strong><a
href="https://www.outsidelands.org/sutro-ghosts.php">Sutro
Park/Forest</a></strong>:</p>
<p>Between 1899 and 1908 a large number of bodies that were apparent
suicides were discovered in Sutro Forest. It is said that many of these
tortured souls can be seen wandering the grounds wearing Victorian dress
on foggy, moonlit nights.</p>

<li><p><strong><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broderick%E2%80%93Terry_duel">Broderick/Terry
Dual, Lake Merced</a></strong>:</p>
<p>Senator David C. Broderick was an ambitious political climber and an
outspoken abolitionist in the Democratic Party. His buddy, California
Chief Justice David S. Terry (who was known for getting into fights and
shanking people), on the other hand, was a staunch supporter of slavery
and advocated for its extension into California. When Terry lost
re-election in 1859, he blamed Broderick for engineering the loss and
challenged him to a duel on the edge of Lake Merced with the idea that
whoever was left standing would win the argument of whether or not
California should have slavery.</p>
<p>Both pistols had hair triggers, but it was Broderick’s that
discharged prior to the final count. He just had to stand there while
Terry took an easy aim at him and fired, hitting his lung. Broderick was
taken back to the home of his friend Leonidas Haskell, where he
languished in pain for three days until he died.</p>
<p>This event became known as the “Last Duel in California,” or the
“Last Notable American Dual”. Broderick would become a martyr for the
anti-slavery movement. Both the location of the dual near Lake Merced
and the Haskell House are said to be haunted by shadowy figures flashing
lights and tipping plants over.</p>

<li><p><strong><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ellen_Pleasant">Mary Ellen
Pleasant</a></strong>:</p>
<p>Mary Ellen Pleasant was a former slave and indentured servant who
came to San Francisco in 1899. She eventually opened up a restaurant and
was notorious for clandestinely picking up stock tips from the wealthy
businessmen who ate there. She was so savvy that she used these tips to
make herself rich, eventually designing and building a bitchin’ mansion
on Octavia Street. She lived there with her business partner and his
wife. Things got a little scandalous when Pleasant was accused of
pushing her business partner down the stairs and killing him. Eventually
she was pressured to move out of San Francisco, lost all her savings,
and died years later. It is said that her spirit haunts the
commemorative park on Octavia and Bush St. If you stand on the plaque
and make a polite request it will be granted. Beware, though, rumor has
it that she throws rocks on the heads of people who do not show her the
proper respect.</p>
<address>
<p>1501 Octavia St</p>
</address></li>
<li><p><strong><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westin_St._Francis">St. Francis
Hotel</a></strong>:</p>
<p>It is widely believed that the famous celebrities of Hollywood have
been haunting Union Square’s St. Francis Hotel for years. The hotel was
the place where the yesteryear actor John Barrymore died in an
earthquake that struck San Francisco in the year 1906, as the actor was
sleeping in one of the hotel rooms. Another story is about a party that
was held in suites 1219 and 1221 by Fatty Arbuckle, a silent-movie
comedian. This grand party apparently got out of control, which led to
the rape and murder of Virginia Rappe, an American model and silent film
actress. Al Jolson, an American singer, comedian, stage and film actor
also died in the same suite during a poker game in the year 1950. The
hotel staff and hotel guests have reported that they have sensed and
felt Barrymore’s, Arbuckle’s and Jolson’s spirits in the hallways of the
hotel.</p>
<address>
<p>Powell St, Union Square</p>
</address></li>
<li><p><strong><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinecrest_Diner">The Pinecrest Diner
Murder</a></strong>:</p>
<p>The Pinecrest Diner sits on the corner of Mason and Geary. The sign
above the door boasts “Best breakfast in San Francisco” and it’s a good
little greasy spoon. However, patrons will notice that the breakfast
menu has an odd addendum on it: no poached eggs. This seemingly
innocuous detail hints at a murder that took place at the diner back in
the late 90’s. In 1997, Hashem Zayed, a cook at the Pinecrest, shot and
killed a waitress. Rumor has it that earlier that week the waitress,
Helen Menicou, had scolded Zayed for making off-menu poached eggs for a
customer. According to the story, Zayed was so upset and embarrassed he
stayed up all night and returned to work the next morning bedraggled and
armed. Zayed never admitted explicitly that the eggs were the cause of
his crime, but the restaurant refuses to serve them to this day.</p>

<li><p><strong><a
href="https://goldengatepark.com/stow-lake-ghost.html">The Lady of Stow
Lake</a></strong>:</p>
<p>There are several origin stories concerning the apparition known as
the <a href="https://goldengatepark.com/stow-lake-ghost.html">Stow Lake
Ghost</a>. Some say she was an absentminded mother wandering Golden Gate
Park’s Stow Lake with a baby in a stroller. She became so enthralled in
a conversation that the stroller rolled into the lake, at which point
the woman panicked and jumped in after her baby, swimming and searching
until both mother and child drowned. Another story says she was an unwed
teen who jumped into the lake and drowned herself to hide her illicit
pregnancy. Either way the legends claim that a white figure of the woman
can be seen wandering the lake shore at night. A related myth claims
that the nearby Pioneer Woman and Children statue will move its stone
face to a different position when the ghost is nearby.</p>
<address>
<p>Stow Lake, Golden Gate Park</p>
</address></li>
<li><p><strong>Former President of the USA Warren G. Harding’s Place of
Death and Possible Ghost</strong>:</p>
<p>Officially, President Warren G. Harding died at the Palace Hotel of a
heart attack but legend has it that he actually died at a bar located
across the street from the Palace Hotel and was transported back to the
hotel via an underground tunnel linking the tavern with the hotel. The
reason for the cover-up was that Harding was President right smack dab
in the middle of prohibition, even though it was well known that the
President liked to imbibe now and again. The bar still exists and is
called the “House of Shields” and they have a large portrait of the
former President hanging on their walls. Guests staying at the Palace
Hotel have reported seeing Harding’s ghost roaming the halls of the
hotel.</p>
<address>
<p>2 New Montgomery St</p>
</address></li>
<li><p><strong><a
href="https://www.nps.gov/places/000/presidio-pet-cemetery.htm">Presidio
Pet Cemetery</a></strong>:</p>
<p>The final resting place for hundreds of animals owned by families
that were stationed at the Presidio, the pet cemetery dates back to the
1950s. According to the National Park Service, there are no official
records for the site, meaning it probably began with the families
themselves, with authorization from one of the commanding officers.</p>
<address>
<p>667 McDowell Ave, Presidio</p>
</address></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Organ">The
Wave Organ</a></strong>:</p>
<p>On a small jetty that extends from behind the Golden Gate Yacht Club
at the end of Marina Green, is a “<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Organ">wave organ</a>” that was
constructed from stone salvaged from the demolition of Laurel Hill
Cemetery in San Francisco. This “instrument” has cement tubes that
extend into the water and as the wave push water in and out of these
tubes, they create haunting sounds. The structure is dedicated to Frank
Oppenheimer as this was his final project before he died. This place is
definitely haunted.</p>
<address>
<p>1 Yacht Rd (walk to end of jetty)</p>
</address></li>
<li><p><strong><a
href="https://noehill.com/sf/landmarks/sf075.asp">Whittier
Mansion</a></strong>:</p>
<p>William Franklin Whittier, a railroad magnate, built this 30-room
mansion in 1894 as a gift to his wife. Unfortunately, she was never able
to live in it as she died in a carriage accident before it was
completed. He died in the home years later of natural causes, and his
son Billy, known for being a slacker and very into partying, sold it in
the 1930s to the German Reich. It operated as the German Consulate from
1938 to 1941, when it is alleged that it housed German spies. It was
seized by the U.S. Alien Property Custodian in 1941 due to WWII, used by
the California Historical Society as their headquarters for a short
time, and is now a private residence once again. And though one doesn’t
necessarily need to begrudge anyone who wants to live in a home with
over 30 rooms, just in case one does, they can take satisfaction in
knowing that the home has been said to be haunted by all sorts of
ghosts. Some say it’s the German spies. Some say it is Billy who haunts
the wine cellar, hoping to get his hands on just one more bottle of
wine, and perhaps saddest of all, some say they have seen a shadowy
figure who is thought to be the ghost of William Whittier, still waiting
for his wife to join him in the house she was never able to call
home.</p>

<li><p><strong><a
href="https://mossbeachdistillery.com/history-ghost/">Moss Creek
Distillery, Moss Creek</a></strong>:</p>
<p>Moss Creek is located on the coast a few miles south of San
Francisco. According to the ghostly legend of “The Blue Lady” in 1912 a
beautiful, young woman met by chance a handsome, dangerous man and fell
in love with him. This dapper ladies’ man was reportedly a piano player
in the bar. The young woman, who would always dress in blue, was already
married to another but her unsuspecting husband never knew of the
illicit affair. She made many trips to the restaurant to be with her
lover. The beautiful lady in blue was killed while walking on the beach
below the restaurant with her lover. The couple were assaulted on the
beach where they both sustained serious injuries. The Lady in Blue
succumbed to her injuries before help could arrive but her lover ended
up surviving. Visitors have reported seeing many telltale signs of the
Lady in Blue, from ghostly blue apparitions to swinging lamps and
stacked glasses. Some say she is still trying to recapture the romance
and excitement of her love affair to this day. The distillery has had
many strange occurrences and has even been featured on <em>Unsolved
Mysteries</em> and <em>Ghost Hunters</em>.</p>
