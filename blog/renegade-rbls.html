          <h2 id="realtime-black-lists">Realtime Black Lists</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In the ceaseless battle against spam, Realtime Black Lists (RBLs)
have emerged as a potent weapon. A RBL contains lists of email servers,
domain names, and IP addresses that are associated with hosting,
producing, forwarding or otherwise contributing to creating spam. Email
servers can reference these lists to determine if an email is being from
a “spammer” host and flagging or denying the message.</p>
<h3 id="gathering-intel">Gathering Intel</h3>
<p>The RBL services use a number of methods to compile lists of IP
addresses reputed to send spam, mostly by using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)">honeypots</a>.
Honeypots are basically email servers setup to accept mail to “poison”
email addresses that have been seeded in the wild by various means but
it doesn’t take much more than simply listing an email address on a web
page for the spam to start flowing. If a honeypot receives any messages
to a “poisoned” email, that sender is a spammer and they are added to
the RBL. Other ways to get added to the RBL include being reported or
having an insecure or improperly configured server (open relays,
etc.).</p>
<h3 id="how-rbls-work">How RBLs Work</h3>
<p>RBLs leverage the DNS service; normally known for looking up IP
addresses for domain names. A suspected spamming domain is added to the
RBLs DNS as host entry. This makes it incredibly simple to check if a
domain or IP address is in the RBL using a normal DNS lookup; if a
record is returned, they are are spammer and you can “blackhole” or
otherwise handle the message as having a high probability of being spam.
<a href="https://www.dnsbl.info/">https://www.dnsbl.info/</a> has a good
short explanation and history of the technology.</p>
<p>But like any tool, RBLs come with their own set of pros and cons so
let’s dive into why they’re both a blessing and a curse and what happens
when a once trusted RBL turns bad.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits">The Benefits</h2>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of the benefits of using an RBL:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Efficient Filtering</p>
<p>The most obvious benefit of RBLs is their ability to efficiently
filter out spam. By cross-referencing incoming emails with a list of
known spam IPs, email servers can quickly identify and block unwanted
messages.</p></li>
<li><p>Resource Savings</p>
<p>Spam filtering can be resource-intensive. RBLs help to alleviate this
by providing a quick way to reject spam before it even enters the
system, saving both computational power and storage space.</p></li>
<li><p>Community-Driven</p>
<p>Many RBLs are maintained by communities of volunteers or
organizations dedicated to internet security. This collective effort
often results in highly accurate and up-to-date lists.</p></li>
<li><p>Flexible</p>
<p>RBLs can be customized to suit the specific needs of an organization.
You can choose to implement multiple lists, or even create your own
based on the spam you encounter.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-drawbacks">The Drawbacks</h2>
<p>There are always two sides to every coin, so let’s take a look at
some of drawbacks of RBLs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>False Positives</p>
<p>The most glaring issue with RBLs is the potential for false
positives. Legitimate emails can sometimes be flagged and blocked, which
can lead to missed opportunities or strained relationships.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of Due Process</p>
<p>Once an IP is blacklisted, it can be challenging to get it removed,
especially if the RBL is not well-maintained. This can be particularly
problematic for dynamic IPs, which may be reassigned to innocent
users.</p></li>
<li><p>Potential for Abuse</p>
<p>RBLs can be weaponized to block competitors or dissenting voices.
Even worse is when an RBL goes bad as I discuss further a bit later.
While neither of these are common, the potential for abuse
exists.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="renegade-rbl-providers-the-uceprotect-case">Renegade RBL
Providers: The UCEPROTECT Case</h2>
<p>While RBLs generally aim to make the digital world a safer place, not
all providers play by the same rules. Some, like UCEPROTECT, have
garnered controversy for their aggressive tactics. The following are
some of the tactics UCEPROTECT uses to extort money from innocent sevice
providers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Broad Strokes: Blocking Entire Subnets</p>
<p>UCEPROTECT is known for blocking entire subnets instead of individual
IPs, a practice that can cause significant collateral damage. This
“guilty by association” approach can result in the blocking of numerous
innocent users who happen to share a subnet with a spam source.</p></li>
<li><p>Pay-to-Play: The Delisting Dilemma</p>
<p>What sets UCEPROTECT apart from most other RBLs is their requirement
for payment to expedite delisting. This has led to accusations of
operating more like a “ransom” service than a legitimate security tool.
While they argue that the fee is a deterrent against spammers, critics
claim it’s a revenue-generating scheme that exploits those desperate to
restore their online reputation.</p></li>
<li><p>Ethical Concerns</p>
<p>Such practices raise ethical questions about the role and governance
of RBL providers. Should they be allowed to hold such sway over online
communications, especially when their actions can affect innocent
parties? And should delisting ever be a paid service, or should it be
based solely on the merit of the case?</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The case of UCEPROTECT serves as a cautionary tale in the use of
RBLs. While these lists can be incredibly useful, it’s crucial to
consider the source and their practices. Always do your due diligence
when choosing an RBL provider, and be aware that some may come with
ethical and practical complications that could do more harm than
good.</p>
<p>Realtime Black Lists offer a powerful means of filtering out spam,
saving resources, and leveraging community knowledge for better
security. However, they are not without their flaws, such as the
potential for false positives and abuse. Like any tool, the key to using
RBLs effectively lies in understanding their limitations and remembering
that not all RBLs are created equal. Choose wisely, and keep an eye out
for those that might be playing fast and loose with your online
security.</p>
