class="mw-headline">How to become a genius</span></h2>
<p>A majority of people carry the potential to become a genius. There
are factors that are far <a
href="/wiki/Simple_formula_for_high_intelligence"
title="Simple formula for high intelligence">more important than genes
and IQ</a>. I have compiled a checklist that I believe should work, when
followed. All you need to begin with is to be free and reasonably
healthy. I try to list the factors that prevent many people from
accomplishing their greatest potential. The list begins with the
stumbling blocks that are most likely to occur on one’s road to genius.
Some factors need to be balanced against each other, and some factors
overlap. For example, the first three preconditions of genius are
strongly related: freedom from <a href="/wiki/Stress_resilience"
title="Stress resilience">stress</a>, <a href="/wiki/Science_of_sleep"
title="Science of sleep">good sleep</a>, and
<a href="/wiki/Self-discipline" class="mw-redirect"
title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. They may provide the key to
answering why we are not (yet) a planet of geniuses. I listed individual
points separately on the basis of their ability to motivate and inspire.
Before you start reading, however, remember what Herbert Simon said
about genius: it takes about ten years to develop it. Not only will you
have to meet all the criteria listed below, but lots of hard work and
patience will be required before you climb that summit!</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-highlight" data-markdown="1">
<p>If you follow these rules religiously, you will be amazed by how much
progress you can make in a decade</p>
</div>
<p>If I scare you with a decade-long time-frame, remember that chances
are good that you will love your self-transformation in weeks. The
younger you are, the ‘messier’ your life, the less you know about your
future, the more powerful the effect.</p>
<h3 id="eliminate-stress"><span id="Eliminate_stress"
class="mw-headline">Eliminate stress</span></h3>
<p>Stress is understood here as rapid change resulting in an increase in
stress hormones (catecholamines, ACTH, cortisol, etc.). Stressful change
can come from conflict, illness, the death of a relative, or
unemployment. Stress can also result from seemingly happy events such as
a wedding or a hasty vacation. A simple test here is to make sure that
creative problems circulate in your mind while you are brushing your
teeth. You will fail the test if, instead of creative thinking, you are
preoccupied with problems at work or in the family. Stress will
dramatically cut down your creative efficiency. Most of all, it will
affect your <a href="/wiki/Self-discipline" class="mw-redirect"

genius. In addition, <a href="/wiki/Chronic_stress"

cortisol, increased activity in the sympathetic system, and a resulting
inhibition of neurogenesis, memory consolidation, creativity, and more.

<h3 id="self-discipline"><span id="Self-discipline"
class="mw-headline">Self-discipline</span></h3>
<p>Lack of self-discipline aggravated by stress and a lack of sleep is
the number one cause of low productivity. The trick to achieving good
self-discipline is to make incremental progress, and convert discipline
into a habit and then into the pleasure of productivity (for more see:
<a href="/wiki/Self-discipline" class="mw-redirect"
title="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</a>). If you develop healthy
self-discipline habits early, your life is likely to take an entirely
different course. If you believe you are lacking in this field, try the
following exercise: as soon as a valuable activity comes to your mind
that you are really unwilling to do, <strong>do it</strong>. Within the
scope and in agreement with human biology, your rational brain must be
the master of your decision making. Stand over a pool of cold water. Do
you hate jumping in? The more you hate it, the sooner you should jump.
And in the end you will
<a href="/wiki/Winter_swimming" class="mw-redirect"
title="Winter swimming">love it</a>. A cold shower is a minor
inconvenience once you experience the volitional power of the brain. You
need to master the skill of perfect execution of your own plans. The
more precise your plan, the harder it is to execute, yet the more
tangible the results. Learn to delay gratification. If you focus on your
long-term goals, your daily inconveniences will be more bearable or even
pleasurable. A strenuous quest towards the goal is the best reward for a
genius mind. Minor awards of laziness do not befit a true genius. Think
of self-discipline daily. Even the strongest minds can relax it all too
easily. Remember about stress and sleep. Stress and sleepiness are chief
factors that undermine self-discipline. Self-discipline cannot quarrel
with biology. In extreme cases, it can actually <a
href="/wiki/War_of_the_networks" title="War of the networks">undermine
your genius</a>. If you are sick, stop working. If you are sleepy, go to
sleep. For comfort, you should know, that with each passing year,
self-discipline will gradually transform into a pleasure. Not only will
you <a href="/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">execute your plans
instinctively</a>, you will also reap the benefits of your earlier
efforts to steer your life in a good direction. In later years, you will
not need much <a href="/wiki/Self-discipline" class="mw-redirect"

<p>Knowledge is the substance you <a

title="How to solve any problem?">convert to great ideas</a>. Although
it is possible to learn in stress or in a <a
href="/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep
deficit</a>, learning is listed here behind stress, sleep and
self-discipline. This is because humans exhibit <a
href="/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">inborn curiosity</a> that
makes them crave learning. TV, tabloid press, and social media thrive on
this need for learning. Most people understand the importance of
learning but are prevented from executing their plans due to stress,
lack of sleep or lack of self-discipline. To breed genius, your whole
life should revolve around learning. You should use every single little
opportunity to learn important things. This could be reading Einstein’s
biography or talking with a homeless person. Read, talk, watch, surf,
and keep on thinking. Do not avoid hard subjects (e.g. mathematics).
Mold your learning strictly to your creative needs, but do not fail to
explore a wide range of topics. Touch all the bases and avoid tunnel
vision! Remember that your success in learning will require appropriate
<a href="/wiki/20_rules" class="mw-redirect" title="20 rules">knowledge
representation</a> and timing of review (as in <a href="/wiki/SuperMemo"
title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>). Are you lacking a university
education? <a href="/wiki/School_dropouts" title="School dropouts">Never
mind</a>. Look at Edison, Lincoln, or Leibnitz to see the power of <a

All the seemingly contradictory requirements listed above can be
reconciled if you structure your learning with <a

<h3 id="abstract-knowledge"><span id="Abstract_knowledge"
class="mw-headline">Abstract knowledge</span></h3>
<p>Except for a great deal of learning, you will need to pay attention
to the <a href="/wiki/Abstract_knowledge"
title="Abstract knowledge">quality of knowledge</a> and its general <a
href="/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a>. You
cannot just memorize thousands of facts. You have to consciously explore
areas such as logic, probability, statistics, game theory, decision
theory, computing sciences, optimization, as well as other branches of
mathematics and sciences. You have to develop a love for logical
thinking, the scientific method, and skepticism. Even if you are a movie
critic, you will still need quality logic to frame your judgment.
Remember that all knowledge is volatile and may be subject to
falsification at any time. Keep your mind open to new truths even if
they seem to turn your present vision of the world upside down</p>
<h3 id="knowledge-representation"><span id="Knowledge_representation"
class="mw-headline">Knowledge representation</span></h3>
<p>The main thing that makes a genius brain stand out is its ability to
store <a href="/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">quality knowledge</a>
in a way that is
<a href="/wiki/20_rules" class="mw-redirect" title="20 rules">easy to
remember</a> and <a href="/wiki/Applicability"
title="Applicability">easy to use</a>. A genius mind can see complex
things in a simple form. It looks at the same text or picture and sees a
dozen times more than an average individual. An average reader will say:
<em>“I understand, so what?”</em>. A genius reader will say:
<em>“Eureka!”</em>, and list several applications of the just acquired
piece of knowledge. Geniuses simplify while learning. They <a
href="/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">generalize</a>. They
build <a href="/wiki/Abstract_knowledge"
title="Abstract knowledge">abstract models</a>. They develop abstract
languages for representing knowledge. Those representation skills can
also be developed by training. Have you ever tried to learn Kanji
(Japanese language symbols)? If you see Kanji as a tangle of confused
sticks, you are a typical beginner. Over time, however, Kanji symbols
should begin to sing to you and talk to you in their own language. Once
you pass the first few hundred, the next thousand should go smoothly.
The same happens if you learn the 20x20 multiplication table. With time
you learn simple tricks for running simple and repetitive calculations.
Instead of memorizing 20x20 combinations, you limit yourself to a
standard 10x10 table (just 25% of all combinations) and add to this a
few rules for manipulating numbers in your <a
href="/wiki/Working_memory" title="Working memory">working memory</a>.
The best way to develop good representations is to (1) understand the
way the memory works (see:
<a href="/wiki/20_rules" class="mw-redirect" title="20 rules">20 rules
of formulating knowledge</a>), (2) consciously modify representations in
the learning process (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Incremental_reading"
title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> supports this
process naturally) (3) work on <a href="/wiki/Abstract_knowledge"
title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> (the more you learn
the easier it becomes), and (4) get
<a href="/wiki/Good_sleep" class="mw-redirect" title="Good sleep">good

title="Neural optimization in sleep">neural optimization in sleep</a>.
If you encounter a difficult problem in <a

reading</a>, postpone it. With luck, some other information source will
present to you a better representation that is easier to assimilate.</p>
<h3 id="health"><span id="Health" class="mw-headline">Health</span></h3>
<p>Take obsessive care of your health! Keep your blood pressure down
(high blood pressure damages your brain), do not
<a href="/wiki/Impact_of_alcohol_on_sleep" class="mw-redirect"
title="Impact of alcohol on sleep">abuse alcohol</a> (any dose that
visibly affects your mental performance may be poisonous to your brain),
use medication only when absolutely necessary, exercise, stay away from
smoking or illicit drugs, learn medical sciences! Your brain is a highly
sensitive organ that needs a healthy environment to operate in. Health
and understanding of the biological needs of your brain may dramatically
affect your performance in the long run. Don’t waste time on <a

<h3 id="negative-emotion"><span id="Negative_emotion"
class="mw-headline">Negative emotion</span></h3>
<p>Learn to control and eliminate negative emotions that blur your mind
and long-term vision. The only acceptable feelings towards others should
be positive, in particular love, compassion, admiration, and
inspiration. Intellectual passion is ok too. If other negative feelings
tend to creep in, emigrate into your creative world. Don’t get swayed or
discouraged by the nasty things in life. Ride on regardless.</p>
<h3 id="optimism-and-patience"><span id="Optimism_and_patience"
class="mw-headline">Optimism and patience</span></h3>
<p>Drive your life into an optimistic track! Do what you love and
develop a strong sense of purpose. Optimism and patience rooted in
<a href="/wiki/Stoicism" class="mw-redirect" title="Stoicism">stoic</a>
philosophy are critical for your brain to peacefully engage in a
creative effort. Optimism has a hormonal basis and as such can be
manipulated and enhanced. It is also based on memory (see: <a
href="/wiki/Learning_and_depression"
title="Learning and depression">Learning and depression</a>). Things
that you love doing should find a place in your schedule. Due to its
intimate and direct impact on the reward system, efficient learning
belongs to the best sources of a positive experience. However, to many
it can also be <a href="/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling"
title="Problem of Schooling">drudgery</a>. For counterbalance you need
to find time for highly enjoyable activities that widen your enthusiasm
for living in general, be it music, art, movies, sports, religion, love,
or other.</p>
<h3 id="the-goal"><span id="The_Goal" class="mw-headline">The
Goal</span></h3>
<p>Even the smartest, most knowledgeable brain does not deserve the
status of genius if it lives in a vacuum. If you switch your focus and
interests indefinitely, you may end up with little creative output to
show for your talents. Establishing a clear goal for your life should be
a priority. If you are very young and still do not understand yourself
or the surrounding world, you can safely commit yourself to enhanced
learning. Until your goals crystallize, learning itself may be your
temporary goal. However, you cannot continue learning for the learning’s
sake indefinitely. At some point you need to focus on a big goal and
your learning should be focused on achieving that goal. Good goals
emerge naturally, and are a reflection of your talents and values. What
do you think is the best thing you could do to make the world a better
place? If you know it, make it your obsession. The greatest minds in
history tended to focus intensely on a single problem and neglect all
minor things in life. Young Bill Gates would sleep under his desk
because he did not want to waste time on coming back home. David Boise,
Al Gore’s star lawyer, would live in a dirty house and run in worn-out
suits to economize more time on getting prepared for his cases. Lincoln
would dress nicely only to please his wife. Einstein became entirely
irresponsive to the outside world once he focused on his relativistic
ideas. Edison would work for days nearly without sleep. Andy Grove of
Intel stated justly: <em>“Only paranoid survive!”</em>. You need a clear
goal and you need to pursue it passionately. As for Gates and Edison,
remember that <a href="/wiki/Science_of_sleep"
title="Science of sleep">quality sleep</a> was listed second on this
checklist. A passionate genius may sleep less, but this will only be
harmless if it comes naturally on demand in the heat of creation. See:
<a href="/wiki/Setting_goals" class="mw-redirect"
title="Setting goals">Setting goals</a></p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-highlight" data-markdown="1">
<p>Goals and passions emerge naturally in a healthy brain free from
major stressors</p>
</div>
<h3 id="balance-learning-and-productivity"><span
id="Balance_learning_and_productivity" class="mw-headline">Balance
learning and productivity</span></h3>
<p>On the one hand, this checklist asks you to work hard to achieve your
goals. On the other hand, it asks you to spend your whole life on
learning. Naturally, you need to find an optimum balance between
learning and productive creativity. This is what Steven Covey calls P/PC
ratio (i.e. the ratio of effort put into production as opposed to
developing the production capacity). A simple rule of thumb is: start
with allocating your time fifty-fifty to learning and creativity.
Gradually, you will see where the bottlenecks develop and you can change
your allocation (in <a href="/wiki/SuperMemo"
title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>, you can use <a href="/wiki/Plan"
title="Plan">Tools : Plan</a> to find your perfect proportion). Each
time you swing away from the optimum balance, your productive output
will be diminished. Your genius cannot be like a pink Cadillac in a
glass showcase. Neither can you neglect developing genius while pursuing
your goals. These two go hand in hand.</p>
<h3 id="passion"><span id="Passion"
class="mw-headline">Passion</span></h3>
<p>Passion, ambition, motivation, energy, and persistence are all
interconnected. The inner drive and the <a href="/wiki/Rage_to_master"
title="Rage to master">rage to master</a> are preconditions of true
genius. The bad news is that those factors are strongly interwoven with
your personality and some have a genetic background. The good news is
that you are probably already sufficiently endowed. After all, you found
this text and you have enough patience to work through it. Even better
news is that <a href="/wiki/Passion_and_memory"
title="Passion and memory">passion involves memory</a>, and as such it
is trainable. For some hints see how the <a href="/wiki/Learn_drive"
title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> can be suppressed or enhanced in: <a
href="/wiki/Schools_suppress_the_learn_drive"
title="Schools suppress the learn drive">Schools suppress the learn
drive</a>. If your drive to learn thrives, your knowledge explodes. This
in turn adds strength to passion, then motivation, then energy, and
persistence. Passion dies from inaction. On the other hand, health
permitting, passion grows with productive efforts combined with
unceasing self-development.</p>
<h3 id="specialization-vs.-versatility"><span
id="Specialization_vs._versatility" class="mw-headline">Specialization
vs. versatility</span></h3>
<p>On the one hand, this checklist asks you to specialize in a narrow
area in which you can become number one in the world. On the other hand,
it asks you to never neglect wide multi-disciplinary learning. Naturally
you need to balance the two. There is no better way to balance your
learning priorities than <a href="/wiki/Incremental_reading"
title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> where knowledge
grows dendritically and spreads in all directions that bring value. Each
time you discover painful gaps in your knowledge, you can add in more
material to incremental reading. Incremental reading puts no limit on
how much material you can import into the learning process and it makes
it possible to spend only as much time on learning as you can afford.
You cannot overload incremental reading. If you add more biology, all
other subjects will proportionally be compressed in priority. This also
makes sure that you do not break down under a load of a temporary fad.
Subjects that decline in priority can be rescheduled and re- /
deprioritized. Reprioritization occurs continually during the learning
process. In incremental reading, you nearly do not need to allocate time
for planning the learning process. Your prioritization can go
concurrently. You will not belong to those people who lose their chance
for success by spreading everything too thin. Neither will you develop
tunnel vision. With rationally controlled learning, you will easily find
an optimum balance between specialization and the big picture and all
that falls in-between.</p>
<h3 id="measure-the-day"><span id="Measure_the_day"
class="mw-headline">Measure the day</span></h3>
<p>Measure your progress by your daily effort and not the distance
remaining to the ultimate goal. Only with this paradoxical approach will
you be able to follow the optimum trajectory. For one, today’s effort is
more tangible than the tiny difference a day often makes on your road.
Productivity is the most satisfying feeling that will drive you to your
greatest heights. Sensing productivity may be the most important
positive emotion of a creative mind. As long as you derive your primary
satisfaction from the perfect execution of your plans that lead to the
big goal, your motivation will remain high and your trajectory correct.
Occasionally, your genius may end up unfulfilled as it was with Charles
Babbage’s differential machine or Ted Nelson’s Xanadu. But this is no
excuse for not trying. This <a href="/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru"

<p>Money distorts goals. If you follow the money trail, you will
optimize against creativity! Money-oriented optimization, at least in
today’s world, will prevent you from developing a clear creative focus.
Very few true geniuses were motivated by money. Most were motivated by
utilitarian goals, <a href="/wiki/Learn_drive"
title="Learn drive">curiosity</a>, or the quest to be the best in their
field. You need to bend your creativity down to earth only as much as to
ensure this checklist is left untouched (esp. in points related to
health, stress, sleep, and time for creative effort). For comfort you
should keep in mind that the Bill Gates’es of the future will be
recruited from the creative elite. All nations work in concert to
develop planetary mechanisms for rewarding geniuses for their invaluable
effort. Genius’s sole job and responsibility is to create and contribute
value.</p>
<h3 id="write-down-ideas"><span id="Write_down_ideas"
class="mw-headline">Write down ideas</span></h3>
<p>Never trust your memory to keep your new ideas. Once you come up with
an idea, write it down instantly. Write it down even when it is only a
hint as to how to solve a problem. Write it down even if you are not
sure if it is correct. You cannot predict how your hint or a shadow of
an idea will affect your future thinking. If the idea seems weak, so is
its memory trace. Charles Babbage said: Write down the thoughts of the
moment. Those that come unsought for are commonly the most valuable.
Graham Bell kept meticulous notes of his ideas that collectively could
help Bell break Edison’s patent record. Botvinnik kept meticulous notes
of his chess game ideas and encouraged his students to follow the same
practice. Bohr’s office had a wall with a narrow drawer in which he
would keep multiple manuscripts in various stages of preparation for
publication. He would not hurry the creative process, but always wanted
to preserve the current state of thinking. Today, the best way to follow
Bell and Bohr is to write down nuggets of ideas straight into the <a
href="/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental
reading</a> process. Once you write down an idea, describe all the
associations of the moment. Gradually, in the incremental review
process, you will reanalyze individual pieces, build upon them,
consolidate, enhance with new knowledge, etc. In the process of
incremental reading, add new ideas to topics that sparked them. This
will also help you understand the impact of associational thinking and
incremental reading on creativity. See: <a
href="/wiki/Incremental_writing" title="Incremental writing">incremental
writing</a></p>
<h3 id="brainstorming"><span id="Brainstorming"
class="mw-headline">Brainstorming</span></h3>
<p>There is a magic power in interaction with other brains. No reading
and no Google can replace another human being as a source of
inspiration. Discuss great ideas with your colleagues in relaxed
one-to-one encounters. Do it in a park or by the lakeside. Avoid
distracting or stressful surroundings such as offices, crowded places,
etc. If your inspirational brains are far away, use incremental
brainstorming via e-mail.</p>
<h3 id="time-management"><span id="Time-management"
class="mw-headline">Time-management</span></h3>
<p>Time-management techniques help one maximize the efficient use of
time. <strong>If you double the time spent on creative activities, you
can increase your lifetime output manifold</strong>. Your efficiency may
not double due to the fatigue factor, but the results of creative output
tend to cumulate, consolidate, and self-amplify over time. Creativity is
a great investment that carries a huge compound interest that will
produce a snowballing effect throughout your life. Learn to use e-mail
instead of a phone or a car. This saves boatloads of time. Regular and
repetitive schedule works best for creativity. This is explained in <a
href="/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle"
title="Natural creativity cycle">natural creativity cycle</a>. If you
are flexible enough to plan to perfection, use <strong><a
href="/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">Plan</a></strong> in <a
href="/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>.
<strong>Plan</strong> will be of great help in optimizing the realistic
allocations of time to individual activities in proportion to their
priority. To enhance your time-management skills, <strong>Plan</strong>
will help you make an exact record of your work. You will see how much
time goes to waste or to low-priority activities. If you have never done
such an exercise before, you are bound to be surprised with the amount
of hidden potential. Time management will release that potential. See:

<h3 id="study-great-people"><span id="Study_great_people"
class="mw-headline">Study great people</span></h3>
<p>Few things are as inspiring as the lives of the greatest individuals
that have walked the planet. Look for strategies that could be helpful
in your own efforts. Biographies of great people should make up a solid
portion of your <a href="/wiki/Incremental_reading"
title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> material</p>
<h3 id="study-yourself"><span id="Study_yourself"
class="mw-headline">Study yourself</span></h3>
<p>Try to document how you got your best ideas in the past, and what
serves your brain best. You should focus on your optimum working
environment, mental state, and the methodology. Self-study is great for
maintaining health. If you use <a href="/wiki/Incremental_writing"
title="Incremental writing">incremental writing</a> for note taking and
creative elaboration, you will realize that the incremental learning
process transforms your notes into a fountain of knowledge about
yourself.</p>
<h3 id="work-your-social-skills"><span id="Work_your_social_skills"
class="mw-headline">Work your social skills</span></h3>
<p>Do not neglect <a href="/wiki/Optimal_socialization"
title="Optimal socialization">skills needed to interact with other
people</a>! Teamwork and cooperation can produce miracles. By alienating
people you may block your ideas from surfacing. Make friends, and avoid
bad lot. Listen to advice but politely refuse to follow it if you
disagree. Never let other people dominate your path in any other way
than through a superior advice. Good people often make little progress
because they let others abuse their politeness. The best way to learn to
say <em>No</em> is to practice that on a regular basis. Paradoxically, a
month of isolation can help you improve your efficient interaction with
others. If you discover how much can be done when you are the boss of
your time, saying <em>no</em> will become much easier.</p>
<h3 id="slug-it-out"><span id="Slug_it_out" class="mw-headline">Slug it

<p>If you need to solve a hard problem, allocate many hours to the goal.
For a period of time, try to forget about the whole world. Toss lots of
new inspirational knowledge into <a href="/wiki/Incremental_reading"
title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>. Slug it out as much
as you can, and then sleep over it. <a
href="/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle"
title="Natural creativity cycle">Learn, think, create, sleep</a>, learn,
think, create, sleep until the problem is solved. Remember that your <a
href="/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep"
title="Neural optimization in sleep">memories are reorganized in
sleep</a>. This is why you will need plenty of sleep at the time of high
creative effort. Most likely, on one beautiful day, you will wake up
with an idea ready for consumption in your half-awoken mind. It is only
the matter of choosing the right problem to match your skills. The
greatest scientists and inventors had a good nose for spotting <a
href="/wiki/Problem_valuation_network"
title="Problem valuation network">solvable problems</a>. If the problem
is solvable with your means, slugging it out in a smart way will produce
a satisfactory outcome. See: <a href="/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F"

<p>To perpetuate genius, provide the best and most inspiring environment
to your own kids. Parental attention is highly correlated with a young
man’s future achievements. History of the greatest minds shows that
loving, caring, inspiring, and warm family was the key to developing
brains that change the world. Remember that attention does not imply
limits on freedom. To maximize human potential, learning and development
must be <a href="/wiki/Free_learning"

<p>It has been two decades since I formulated the checklist above
(2001). I am proud to see many young lives thrive on my prescription.
However, I also see a great deal of failure. The checklist for failure
is much shorter. It basically boils down to two factors: <mark>stress
and sleep</mark>. With stress and bad sleep,
<a href="/wiki/Self-discipline" class="mw-redirect"
