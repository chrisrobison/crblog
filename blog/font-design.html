          <p>I hate starting out a new article. I never know how to break the ice;
to get the ball rolling. Once I get started I’m fine. But getting
started can be tough. I get in my head and start overthinking things:
“How technical should I go?”, “Will they be reading this on their phones
or desktop?”, “Will anybody actually read this besides me and my Mom?”
or “Should I start with a joke? But in the end, I usually churn out
something I would turn in to my 11th grade English teacher that I wrote
the night before; a passable attempt but we both know I could do better.
Well, this time I -will- do better, for you dear reader (Hi Mom!). Now
would you look at that. I’m a paragraph in, rambling and very off topic.
Let’s talk fonts. Let’s me start again…</p>
<p>As digital experiences continue to evolve, the choice of fonts in web
and mobile design plays a pivotal role in shaping user engagement and
readability. Like it or not, we now live in a world where we are
inundated with information. How can anyone get their message to stand
out amongst all the other billboards, ads, blog posts or images? By
choosing the right design, typeface and font that will best convey
<em>your</em> message and -engage- your audience. In this article I’ll
give a short history of print and delve into why your font choice can
make all the difference when it comes to getting your message
across.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:center;font-weight:300;font-size:12px;">
An engraving of an early printing press
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I must admit, when I started to write this post I thought it was
going to be a quick and easy how-to on the use of some of the more
modern font technologies such as variable and color fonts. How wrong I
was. As I was researching and writing the history of the printed word I
was astounded at how deeply influencial the written word has been on the
development of humanity. From the early wide-spread use of pressing
reeds into clay to form cuneiform tablets to the scrolls of ancient
Greece and Egypt; to Gutenberg’s printing press and Martin Luther’s
protest nailed to the door of the Wittenberg Church; to yellow
journalism newspapers fanning the flames of war and the fake news of
today, the printed word, by hand or machine, has had a profound impact
on the development of our society.</p>
<p>Well that intro got a lot longer than I was planning but I apparently
have a new passion and respect for fonts and print design. I should
probably break this up into multiple posts. Anyway, we should all
remember the long and arduous journey humanity has taken over the past
3,000 years to get us to where we are today. With a nearly unlimited
array of designs choices to convey our messages and a historically
unprecedented freedom to communicate with nearly anyone else on the
planet at an instant, we need to take seriously how influencial a font
choice can be to getting our message across. I know it sounds a little
silly, but it’s the little things like this that can make all the
differnece. Typography is not just about choosing a pretty typeface;
it’s about communication, readability, and getting the user engaged with
your message.</p>
<h2 id="font-vocabulary">Font Vocabulary</h2>
<p>The print &amp; design industry have a vocabulary all their own.
Western society has been pressing out books since 1454 (see what I did
there?) and the list of words we use to describe how the print looks on
paper has grown to be quite large. Seemingly similar concepts have
subtle differences (see Legibility vs Readability, Typeface vs
Font).</p>
<p>Yet, we use many of these terms everyday; Did you know we get the
words “UPPERCASE” and “lowercase” from the original Movable Type
Printing Press? The UPPERCASE letters were held in the, well in the
upper case of the press. I’ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to
guess where the lowercase letters were stored or is this just an
apocryphal story?</p>
<p>I should warn you that I love to make lists. Love. Them. They help me
keep my writing more concise. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I can
get off topic and ramble on pretty easily but I’ve learned to be more
succinct by using lists! So don’t be surprised if you come across a few
lists in my posts. Speaking of lists, here’s a list of some basic
terminology in the world of fonts and print design that I found to be
interesting, confusing, ambiguous or just felt I needed to make note
of:</p>
<figure style="float:right;width:320px;display:inline-block;padding:1rem;">
<img src="/crblog/assets/img/font-signs/5.png" width="320">
<figcaption style="text-align:center;font-weight:300;font-size:12px;">
Moveable type from a printing press
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Typeface vs. Font</strong>: A typeface is the design of
the lettering (e.g., Times New Roman), while a font is a specific style
and size of that typeface (e.g., Times New Roman, 12pt, Bold).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Serif vs. Sans Serif</strong>: Serif typefaces, like
Times New Roman, have small lines at the end of their strokes, while
sans-serif typefaces, like Arial, do not. Serifs are traditionally seen
as more formal, while sans-serifs are viewed as modern and
clean.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Legibility vs. Readability</strong>: Legibility refers to
how easily individual characters can be distinguished, while readability
is about how easy it is to read and understand blocks of text.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hierarchy and Emphasis</strong>: Different fonts and
styles (like bold or italic) are used to create a hierarchy or to
emphasize certain parts of the content.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sizing &amp; Units</strong>: This starts to get a little
out of scope here but…I just want to remind everyone that with a little
up-front planning using responsive design, <span class="citation"
data-cites="media-queries">@media-queries</span> and the right relative
units, the same markup can be used for any screen size or print
resolution. I am still surprised at the number of companies I still see
maintaining multiple codebases for desktop and mobile websites. With
variable fonts and color icon fonts you can make the same markup look
good from 72dpi to 1200dpi. Down with bitmaps! Long live vector
graphics!</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="key-considerations">Key Considerations</h2>
<p>When we need a font, most of us will just scroll through the ‘Font’
menu until we see a font we like. But for any choice you need to make,
you need to do your due diligence by defining the parameters and
constraints your final choice will need to stay within. The choice of
font you use will be driven by a number of things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Target Audience</strong>: The choice of font should
resonate with the target audience. For example, a children’s app might
use a more playful font compared to a corporate website.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Platform</strong>: The platform (web, mobile, app)
dictates font choices due to varying screen sizes and
resolutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Brand Identity</strong>: Fonts should align with the
brand’s personality – whether it’s formal, friendly, or
avant-garde.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Consider users with visual
impairments. Fonts should be legible and sizable to accommodate all
users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Heavier font files can slow down
site speed, impacting user experience and SEO.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s explore the importance of
font choice in web and mobile design, including the innovative world of
variable and color fonts.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="why-font-choice-matters-in-digital-design">Why Font Choice
Matters in Digital Design</h2>
<p>Font choices in print and web design are crucial for several reasons.
I warned you about the lists:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>User Engagement</strong>: The right font can improve user
engagement. A well-chosen font can make text more appealing and
inviting, encouraging visitors to stay longer on a website or read more
of a printed piece.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Readability</strong>: On smaller screens, fonts
with larger x-heights and open spacing prevent straining the eyes,
making content more accessible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tone and Mood Setting</strong>: Fonts can convey
different moods and tones. For instance, a serif font like Times New
Roman might convey formality and tradition, suitable for a law firm’s
website, while a sans-serif font like Arial might feel more modern and
informal, fitting for a tech startup.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Brand Identity</strong>: Fonts can be a powerful tool in
conveying your brand’s personality and values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Professionalism and Credibility</strong>: A well-chosen
font can enhance the professional appearance of a design, lending
credibility to the content. Poor font choices can have the opposite
effect, making a design look amateurish.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compatibility and Performance</strong>: On the web, font
choice can affect loading times and compatibility across different
devices and browsers. Some fonts are optimized for web use and ensure
consistent rendering across various platforms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adaptability Across Devices</strong>: With an increasing
variety of screen sizes, from desktops to smartwatches, fonts must be
versatile and legible across all platforms.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, fonts are a very important and integral part of how
you communicate with your audience. I must admit, I thought this would
be a quick short blog entry on using color fonts but the more I
researched and wrote, the more I realized how deeply influencial font
choices can be and how underappreciated print design is. Well now that
we’ve got the fundamentals out of the way, let’s get to the good
stuff.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-fonts-in-web-and-mobile-design">Implementing Fonts
in Web and Mobile Design</h2>
<p>We are going to take a look at how to implement this in practice
using <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>, a popular
and versatile repository of fonts provided by Google that are free to
use. They provide a variety of styles including some very convicing
handwriting fonts.</p>
<h3 id="htmlcss-example-with-google-fonts">HTML/CSS Example with Google
Fonts</h3>
<p>First, choose a font from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google
Fonts</a>. For this example, we’ll use ‘Roboto’, a highly legible sans
serif font for web and mobile interfaces, ‘Noto Serif’, a very legible
serif font and pair those with ‘Shadows Into Light’ as a companion font.
Feel free to look through Google’s font collection and pick your
own.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at that markup:</p>
<h4 id="html">HTML</h4>
<pre class="html"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Serif:wght@300&amp;family=Roboto:wght@300;400;700&amp;family=Shadows+Into+Light&amp;display=swap&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Font Example&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Heading Styled with Roboto&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is styled with Roboto, optimized for readability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#39;serif&#39;&gt;Good font combinations &lt;span class=&#39;cursive&#39;&gt;Emphasize&lt;/span&gt; the right words..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="css">CSS</h4>
<pre class="css"><code>body {
    font-family: &#39;Roboto&#39;, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
    font-family: &#39;Roboto&#39;, sans-serif;
    font-size: 2em; /* Larger size for headings */
    font-weight: 700; /* Bolder weight for impact */
}

p {
    font-size: 1em; /* Standard size for body text */
    font-weight: 400; /* Regular weight for readability */
}

.serif {
    font-family: &#39;Noto Serif&#39;, serif;
    font-size: 1rem;
    width: 80rem;
    border-radius: 1rem;
    height: 4rem;
    background-color: #ccc;
}

.cursive {
    font-family: &#39;Shadows Into Light&#39;, cursive;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="result">Result</h4>
<p><img src='/crblog/assets/img/font-example1.png' width="100%"></p>
<h2 id="the-future-with-variable-and-color-fonts">The Future with
Variable and Color Fonts</h2>
<h3 id="variable-fonts">Variable Fonts</h3>
<p>Variable fonts represent a significant advancement in digital
typography. They allow a single font file to behave like multiple fonts,
offering a range of styles, weights, and widths. This is particularly
beneficial in web and mobile design for several reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: A single variable font file can
replace multiple font files, reducing load times and improving website
performance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Designers can fine-tune the style,
weight, or width of the font dynamically, offering greater creative
control over typography.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improved User Experience</strong>: They allow for
real-time adjustment of fonts according to user preferences or device
characteristics, enhancing accessibility.</p></li>
</ol>
<figure style="float:right;">
<img src="/crblog/assets/img/variable.svg" width="100%">
<figcaption style="font-size:0.7rem;text-align:center;">
<em>Variations can be combined. The first example has a light weight and
body-like optical size; the second has a heavy weight and display-like
optical size (note the higher contrast); the third also has a similarly
heavy weight, but with a body-like optical size.</em>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Using a variable font is as easy as using a normal, non-variable
font. The only difference is the size of the variable font file can be
quite a bit larger as they must store more information for each
character. Something to keep in mind if you are targeting mobile users
or users with slow connections. Here’s how you can implement a variable
font using Google Fonts:</p>
<h4 id="html-1">HTML</h4>
<pre class="html"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Flex&amp;display=swap&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Font Example&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Heading Styled with Roboto&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is also styled with Roboto, optimized for readability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="css-1">CSS</h4>
<pre class="css"><code>body {
    font-family: &#39;Roboto Flex&#39;, sans-serif;
    font-variation-settings: &#39;wght&#39; 400, &#39;wdth&#39; 100;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 2em; /* Larger size for headings */
    font-weight: 700; /* Bolder weight for impact */
}

p {
    font-size: 1em; /* Standard size for body text */
    font-weight: 400; /* Regular weight for readability */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="/crblog/assets/img/roboto-flex.png" style="width:100%"></p>
<p>As you can see, implementing a variable font is identical to using a
normal font, we just update the font to download and change the CSS to
reflect the new font name. If anything, it’s even easier as we do not
need to specify each weight and varient we want to use when we include
our external font. They are all included in the variable font. So in
this example, you can adjust the <code>wght</code> and <code>wdth</code>
associated with ‘Roboto Flex’ to change how the weight and width axes
are rendered. You can adjust these values throughout your CSS to suit
your design needs.</p>
<h2 id="color-fonts">Color Fonts</h2>
<h3 id="uses-and-abuses">Uses and Abuses</h3>
<figure style="float:right;width:320px;display:inline-block;padding:1rem;">
<img src="/crblog/assets/img/font-signs/8.png" width="320">
<figcaption style="text-align:center;font-weight:300;font-size:12px;">
Traffic signs exemplify font consistency
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I love color fonts. There are some purists out there that feel text
should only be a single color, black. They cite readability concerns and
start mumbling something about <a
href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/">Edward Tufte</a> and <span
style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:bold;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">ComicSans</span>.
But color fonts, also known as chromatic fonts, are the latest
innovation in typography and they bring the richness of color and
texture into text. While this opens up new possibilities for branding
and design, allowing fonts to include multiple colors, gradients, and
even textures it also provides opportunity for creating designs that are
busy and difficult to read. In web design, color fonts can be used
to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Enhance Branding</strong>: Color fonts can include brand
colors and textures, making text an integral part of the brand
identity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improve Visual Interest</strong>: They add a new
dimension to typography, making it more visually appealing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create Consistent Aesthetics</strong>: Using color fonts
can ensure consistent color schemes across different platforms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide icons for UI or social networks</strong>:
Including icons in a font in nothing new (see <a
href="https://fontawesome.com/">FontAwesome</a>), color fonts allow us
to go a step further and create our own bespoke fonts containing all the
social service and user interface icons we need for our site or
application.</p></li>

<h3 id="how-they-work">How They Work</h3>
<p>A color font file is actually just a regular font file that embeds
additional data to display more graphic properties than the contour
shapes of a character.</p>
<p>Color fonts are now generally stored as SVG data inside OpenType font
files. This SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format can hold vector shapes
with color or gradients, and may also include bitmap images - thus
leading to bitmap fonts.</p>
<p>On top of all this, While doing research for this article I
discovered that color fonts are now officially referred as
<b>OpenType-SVG fonts</b>.</p>
<p>You’re probably thinking how simple, straightfoward and level-headed
this all sounds. Nothing but sunshine and rainbow fonts. Right?</p>
<p>Well, the reality is a bit more complex…</p>
<h3 id="time-for-some-history">Time For Some History</h3>
<p>The OpenType-SVG font format was initially designed by Mozilla &amp;
Adobe and became an industry standard in early 2016, when other big
players including Microsoft &amp; Google agreed on a single format to
support color fonts.</p>

All of them (including Apple) have previously developed and implemented
their own proprietary color formats to display emojis on their operating
systems, while many other companies built other custom color font
technologies for the gaming, video or print industries.</p>
<p>There are now four major color font formats that fit into regular
font files: SBIX, COLR, CBDT and SVG, each having it own specificities.

<p>Due to the differences and incompatibilities of these formats, the
design industry is going through a transition period during which
several color font formats may be needed to ensure cross-platform
compatibility across several operating systems, browsers and apps.</p>
<p>But OpenType-SVG seems in great position to become a golden standard
now that <b>three operating systems support OpenType-SVG fonts</b>:
Windows 10, macOS Mojave, and iOS 12.</p>
<p>A solution to mitigate this issue on legacy software? Color fonts can
also include some alternate <b>vector shape data as a fallback
solution</b> for software that do not (yet) support any of the embedded
color formats.</p>

<p>So as you’ve probably guessed by now, there are drawbacks to color
fonts. The biggest one is filesize (see what I did there?). A color font
file is generally larger than a regular font file, and a lot more so
when the font embeds high-resolution bitmap characters.</p>
<p>Whereas fonts usually weigh 10-100 kilobytes, color vector fonts can
reach 100KB to 2MB+ depending on their visual complexity.</p>
<p>Color bitmap fonts may range from a few megabytes to tens of
megabytes, and sizes increase when multiple color font formats are
embedded in a single file.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>Implementing color fonts can be as simple as using them in your CSS,
similar to regular fonts. However, it’s important to ensure
compatibility, as support for color fonts can vary across different
browsers and devices. Color fonts hijack a feature for rendering of
diacritic marks, such as umlauts (¨), over vowels in order to render
multiple layers of charaters over each other in order to achieve the
effect. Just be sure to test thoroughly in all your potential
environments to ensure proper rendering when using color fonts.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The world of web and mobile typography is becoming more vibrant and
alive with the advent of these latest font capabilities. These
innovations offer designers unprecedented flexibility and creative
possibilities, making it an exciting time to be in web and mobile
design. As always, the key is to balance creativity with functionality,
ensuring that your design choices enhance the user experience. The right
font choice is key to creating an engaging and accessible digital
experience. By considering optical sizing and using tools like Google
Fonts, designers can craft visually appealing and functional web and
mobile interfaces. Remember, typography is not just about making words
readable; it’s about bringing content to life.</p>
