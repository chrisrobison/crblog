# Adding Comments: A Sneak Peek into the Creative Process of Expanding Functionality

Come check out the creative workflow of a software engineer as I extend my home-grown WordPress replacement with threaded comment functionality.

### Background

When I started this site I nearly installed WordPress as the software to manage and maintain my blog but in the end, I did not. Don't get me wrong, WordPress is a fine piece of software.  I just feel that it's codebase has become a bit bloated and heavy for my tastes and WordPress security is an afterthought that doesn't really work simply because of the way the software has been architeched. So I decided to go ahead and reinvent the wheel, as it were, and create my own blog hosting software that is designed to be more secure, responsive, easier to use, harder to abuse and actually be fun to work with. Everything is configured via JSON files so no SQL or DB server to maintain.
