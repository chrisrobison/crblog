## What is a Honeypot Email Address?

A honeypot email address is a decoy email that you use exclusively for signing up on websites, newsletters, or online services.

## How to Set Up a Honeypot Email Address

Setting up a honeypot email address has varying levels of difficulty, depending on your expertise, your ISP's tools and mostly your ability to create many unique email aliases or accounts. This requires a domain that you control that receives email that you can configure or a whole lot of gmail accounts.

### Step 1: Create a New Email Address
Create a new email address that you'll use solely as your honeypot. This should be separate from your personal or work email to avoid any confusion.

### Step 2: Use Aliases
Many email providers like Gmail allow you to create aliases by appending a plus sign and additional text to your email address (e.g., `yourname+website@gmail.com`). This way, you can track which website the spam is coming from.

### Step 3: Sign Up
Use this honeypot email when signing up for newsletters, online services, or any website that requires an email address.

Keep an eye on the inbox and take note of any unsolicited emails. If you start receiving spam, check the alias to identify the source.
