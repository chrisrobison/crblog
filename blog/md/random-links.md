# Random Stuff: A Few Links and Thoughts on Black Friday

I was just using this gorgeous day to do some deep cleaning and catch up on some online reading and thought I'd share a few things I found interesting.

- [The Failed Commodification of Technical Work](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-failed-commodification-of-technical-work/) - Great breakdown on why technical and creative work cannot be easily commodified. 
- [APT for Cygwin](https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/) - omg. I have literally been waiting for this my entire adult life. You have no idea how ridiculously happy this makes me. It's a little disconcerting to discover that a package manager can make me this giddy. [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) is a pretty robust UNIX/Linux-like environment for windows. It does a great job at translating unixy concepts to their Windows equivalent, even things like cron and sshd can be run as 'daemons' which ends up starting services in the Windows environment. The only problem up until now was that the only package manager was the initial 'setup.exe' that was run to install the cygwin environment. This app is a windows GUI app that still retains it vintage Windows2K design elements. It doesn't re-install everything over again every time you install something new; it just installs new or updated packages. The GUI app takes a long time to load and is quite cumbersome to use. If I need a cli app for something, say resize an image, and I notice there is no pnmscale, I can now simply type 'apt-cyg install netpbm' and all the netpbm image tools will be installed, without taking me out of my workflow. I just needed to sing the praises of both Cygwin and God bless the creator of apt-cyg. You are truly a Hero among men.
